- I spend my time figuring out what businesses are worth, just like we did with Jason’s business. If I can buy a business for a lot less than I think it’s worth, I buy it!”
- whatever career they choose in the future, they’ll definitely need to learn how to invest some of their earnings.
- But there is a catch. The catch is that you have to listen to a long story, you have to take the time to understand the story, and most important, you have to actually believe that the story is true. In fact, the story even concludes with a magic formula that can make you rich over time.
- Unfortunately, if you don’t believe the magic formula will make you rich, it won’t.
- The formula will take significantly less time and effort than doing the “work” yourself, and will provide better results for most people.

- GETTING STARTED is a big deal. It takes a great amount of discipline to save any money.
- it’s simply much EASIER and more immediately rewarding to find something to spend it on.
- Saving money for things that you might want or need in the future rather than wasting money IS IMPORTANT. But once you have the mony What will you do?:
  - Plan A: Piggy Bank: Money lost value along the time
  - Plan B: Put the money in the bank. Poor gainings
  - Plan C: Buy Bonds (lend to businesses or to group of individuals yourself). Gives you more GAIN, **BUT**  If you buy a bond from one of these companies and something goes wrong with its business, you may never get your interest or your money back. For tat reason *riskier* companies, usually have to pay higher interest rates than more solid, established ones.
  - Plan C2: if you’re not comfortable taking any risk of losing your $1,000, the U.S. government sells bonds, too. Less gainings but more secure!. They give `6% per year` for money locked up for 10 year. This is important because:
    - If anyone asks you to loan them money or to invest with them over the long term, they better expect to pay you more than 6 percent a year.
    - If somenone wants money for a share of his gum business, that investment better earn you more than 6 percent per year.
    - If Jason wants to borrow money over the long term, same deal. He better expect to pay you a lot more than 6 percent.
    - Because you can get 6 percent a year without taking any risk. All you have to do is lend money to the U.S. government, and they’ll guarantee that you receive your 6 percent each and every year, along with all of your money back after 10 years.

- How about investing your money in a business?
-  So, suppose this:
   -  There is a business which its owner valued in `12 millions`
   -  He wants to sell the half of his business in `6 millions`
   -  So, he divides his business into `1 million shares`. He keeps `500 000 shares` and sell the other `500 000` for the aforementioned `6 millions`. (This is `12$` per share).
- Is is a good idea to buy a share for 12$?
- To answer this question we need to know the profits of the business, lets say the profit was `10 million`. Administrative expenses, tazes and etc. The net income will be `1 200 000 dollars`.
- So `1200 000 dollar` of income and `1 000 000 shares` makes `1.2 dollars` per share. Since 1 share is `12 dollars`. This represents `10%` in return!. BUT How can evaluate this?
- First, `10%` was earned last year. Which is a good starting point but it does not mean that it will return the same quantity this year. It could be more... or less...
- Second, me have to determine *how confident* we are in our prediction. If we have too many doubts, government bond may start to look a whole lot better.
-Third, how will the incomes evolve along the years?.

- FIGURING OUT WHAT A BUSINESS is worth isn’t easy
- I then point out that that’s a pretty wide range of prices for shares and a pretty short period of time for them to change so much. Looking at the price for shares over a two-to three-year period would give us an even wider range.
- How can this be? These are big, well-known companies. Each of these companies has divided its ownership into millions (and sometimes billions) of equal shares.
- The trading back and forth of these ownership shares takes place in a number of locations and over computer networks. These ownership shares are referred to as **shares of stock**, and collectively, this buying and selling activity is referred to as the **stock market**.
- Can a company that large be worth $30 billion one day and then a few months later be worth $60 billion? Are they selling twice as many cars, making twice as much money, or doing something drastically different in their business to justify such a large change in value?
  - No! It makes no sense that the values of most companies swing wildly from high to low, or low to high, during the course of each and every year. On the other hand, it seems pretty clear that the prices of the shares in most companies swing around wildly each and every year. All you have to do is look in the newspaper to see that that’s true.

- SO...**Why do the prices of all these businesses move around so much
each year if the values of their businesses can’t possibly change that much?**
  - SHORT ANSWER: Who knows and who cares?
  - The truth is that I don’t really have to know why people are willing to buy and sell shares of most companies at wildly different prices over very short periods of time. **I just have to know that they do!**

- AN APPLICATION EXAMPLE: If, according to the daily newspaper, General
Motors is selling for 37 per share, you have three choices: You can buy shares in General Motors for 37 each, you can sell your shares in General Motors and receive 37 each, or you can do nothing. 
  - If you think GM is really worth 70 per share, then you might consider $37 a
ridiculously low price and decide to buy some shares. 
  - If you think GM is really worth only 30 or 35 per share (and you happen to own some shares), you might decide to sell to “Mr. Market” at 37. 
  - If you think each share of General Motors is worth between 40 and 45 per share, you may decide to do nothing. At 37 per share, the price is not at a big enough discount for you to buy, nor is 37 a generous enough offer tomake you want to sell.
- Buying shares of a company only when they trade at a large discount to true value is called as **investing with a margin of safety** . 
  - The difference between your estimated value per share of, say, 70 and the purchase price of your shares of perhaps 37 would represent a *margin of safety for your investment*.
- Always using the margin of safety principle when deciding whether to purchase shares of a business from a crazy partner like *Mr. Market* was the secret to
making safe and reliable investment profits. But there's still a problem here:
  - First, how are you supposed to know what a business is worth?
  - Second, f you could figure out a fair price or price range for the business, how would you know whether you were right, or even close to right?
  - Third, aren’t there tons of smart, hardworking people trying to figure out all this stuff, too? Wouldn’t these people scoop up all of the obvious bargains before you got there? How can you compete with them?

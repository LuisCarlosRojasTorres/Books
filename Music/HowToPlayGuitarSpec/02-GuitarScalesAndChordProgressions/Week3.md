##  1. <a name='ChordsandProgressions'></a>Chords and Progressions

###  1.1. <a name='Introduction'></a>Introduction
- you'll be able to play:  
  - chord progressions found in many popular songs
  - a 12- blues, which is a common song form across all genres. 
###  1.2. <a name='IIVVandIVIV'></a>I IV V and I V IV
- If we take `G` as `I`:
  - `II`: `A`
  - `III`: `B`
  - `IV`: `C`
  - `V`: `D`
- So:
  - I IV V means: G C D 
  - I V IV means: G D C

###  1.3. <a name='PracticingIIVVandIVIV'></a>Practicing I IV V and I V IV
![](/Music/HowToPlayGuitarSpec/02-GuitarScalesAndChordProgressions/uploads/W3-01.PNG)

Now that we're familiar with the both open and barre I IV V chords in the key of G, let's play through the following progression. Just as you've done before, practice with a metronome and play one down stroke per beat (four per measure). Play the progression one time through with open chords and one time through with barre chords. Once you feel comfortable, feel free to switch it up and play both open and barre chords throughout the progression:

###  1.4. <a name='IVIIIIVandIVIIVIV'></a>I VI II V and I VI IV V
- This chord progression is mostly found in songs from the doo-wop era
- - If we take `G` as `I`:
  - `II`: `A`
  - `III`: `B`
  - `IV`: `C`
  - `V`: `D`
  - `VI`: `E`
- So:
  - I VI IV V means: G Em C D (pop)
  - I VI II V means: G Em Am D (jazz)
  
###  1.5. <a name='PracticingIVIIIIVandIVIIVIV'></a>Practicing I VI I II V and I VI IV IV

For the following exercises, remember to use a metronome to keep in time. Set your metronome to a slower beat and gradually increase the speed as you get more comfortable with these exercises: accuracy over speed always. To begin, just use a simple downstroke for four beats on each chord - don't worry about adding a strumming pattern. And remember, have fun and it's ok if you make mistakes!

###  1.6. <a name='IVVIIV'></a>I V VI IV
- people create entire jam sessions open to the public where all they play is chord progression. Many of the songs had this chord progression. Songs from Broadway, hiphop songs, rock songs, you name it.
- If we take `G` as `I`:
  - `II`: `A`
  - `III`: `B`
  - `IV`: `C`
  - `V`: `D`
  - `VI`: `E`
- So:
  - I V VI IV means: G D Em C 

- If we take `C` as `I`:
  - `II`: `D`
  - `III`: `E`
  - `IV`: `F`
  - `V`: `G`
  - `VI`: `A`
- So:
  - I V VI IV means: C G Am F 
- If we take `D` as `I`:
  - `II`: `E`
  - `III`: `F`
  - `IV`: `G`
  - `V`: `A`
  - `VI`: `B`
- So:
  - I V VI IV means: D A Bm G 

###  1.7. <a name='PracticingIVVIIV'></a>Practicing I V VI IV
For the following exercises, remember to use a metronome to keep in time. Set your metronome to a slower beat and gradually increase the speed as you get more comfortable with these exercises: accuracy over speed always. To begin, just use a simple downstroke for four beats on each chord - don't worry about adding a strumming pattern. And remember, have fun and it's ok if you make mistakes!

Let's start by practicing the I V VI IV chord progression in the key of G. We'll play G D Em C in open position and then with barre chords:

###  1.8. <a name='The12BarBlues'></a>The 12 Bar Blues
- it's something that we all have in common as musicians, jazz, rock, 
- a very basic form of the 12 bar blues which is I IV V.
  - 12 bars: 
    - 4 bars of I 
    - 2 bars of IV
    - 2 bars of I
    - 2 bars of V
    - 2 bars of I
###  1.9. <a name='PracticingThe12BarBlues'></a>Practicing The 12 Bar Blues

For the following exercises, remember to use a metronome to keep in time. Set your metronome to a slower beat and gradually increase the speed as you get more comfortable with these exercises: accuracy over speed always. To begin, just use a simple downstroke for four beats on each chord - don't worry about adding a strumming pattern. And remember, have fun and it's ok if you make mistakes!

By now, you should be familiar with both open and barre chord fingerings for the I chord, the IV chord, and the V chord in the key of G Major. Let's begin by practicing the basic 12-bar blues in the key of G Major. Play through the progression once using open chords and once using barre chords:

Great! Now let's try practicing the 12-bar blues with variations. Just as before, play through the progression once with open chords and once with barre chords. Remember to use your metronome and use a simple downstroke for each beat (four per measure):

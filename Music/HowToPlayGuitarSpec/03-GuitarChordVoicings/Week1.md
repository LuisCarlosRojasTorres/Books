##  1. <a name='Gettingstarted'></a>Getting started

### Welcome
- This course focuses on:
  - developing a clear understanding of chordal shapes on the guitar. By building this knowledge, you will develop a better understanding of the instrument. 
  - look at a lead sheet and play a variety of chord voicings. 
  - improve your capacity to construct triads, seventh chords, and inversions. 
  - to construct different chords up and across the neck of the guitar.
  - creating triad inversions in major and minor keys
  - learn about Power chords and Drop-2 voicings
  - play and know the voicings of various chord qualities including major triads, minor triads, and seventh chords
  - play with better technique and ear training
  - gospel chords and using chord substitions to create fuller harmonic sounds All of these chord voicings will include drills that you can do on your own to improve your fingering on the guitar.

###  2.1. <a name='Overview'></a>Overview
- Triads and its inversions are powerful
- We're going to be **working on triads** across (vertically) the fret board and up (horizontally) the fret board.
- This helps to play chords in any position

###  2.2. <a name='TechniqueTips'></a>Technique Tips
- Play bar chords right next to the desired fret.
- Time and tone are not optional

Up and Across the Fretboard
First, let's clarify a few terms. We will be looking at two ways to work on chord inversions on the guitar: up and down the fretboard and across the fretboard.

Up and down the fretboard refers to moving voicings from the lower-numbered frets to the higher numbered frets (where the higher pitches are).

Across refers to taking the inversions from the higher-pitched strings to the lower-pitched strings.

**Major Triad Inversions Up the Fretboard**
To invert a chord, move the bottom note up an octave. A root-position C triad is spelled C E G. Moving the C (the bottom note) up an octave yields E G C. 

A major triad with the third in the bottom is called a triad in first inversion. 

To get a second inversion triad, move the E up an octave, giving you G C E. A triad with the fifth of the chord in the bass is called a triad in second inversion.

**First Inversion:**

To make a first inversion chord, take the tonic of a root position chord and move it up an octave.

**Second Inversion:**

To make a second inversion chord from a first inversion chord, simply move the third up an octave.

On the top string set 3-2-1, root position C triad is playable in third position, first inversion in eighth position, and second inversion in twelfth position as indicated in the notation below.

**Triad Inversions Across the Fretboard**
When we move inversions up the fretboard, we take the bottom note of a root position triad and moved it up an octave. Let's look at the concept of inverting chords across the fretboard.

Look at a C major triad, played in root position.

To move the triad across the fretboard, take the G on string 1 and transfer it down an octave to string 4. You will have to change your fingering around to accommodate the new shape (a fifth-fret barre with the first finger across 432 will do nicely). This leaves us with a C major triad over G. This is called a second-inversion triad.

We now have an E in the highest note of the voicing. Let's transfer that note down an octave to achieve another inversion. Take the E on string 2 and transfer it down an octave to string 5. Use of the third finger works well while continuing to barre on 4-3 with the first finger. This is called a first inversion triad.

Finally, to return to the root position triad, move the C on the third string down an octave to the sixth string. We now have a root position triad, with the root on the sixth string.

**Close and Open Positions**
Because there are six strings on the guitar and many ways to play the same note, there are also many ways to play a chord, and many ways to configure the notes within it. We subgroup the configurations for convenience, into two categories: "close position" or "open position." 

Close position refers to the arrangement of the notes of a chord in the closest possible configuration. For example, a C chord configured with voices in the order C E G is in close position, because the notes are all very close together. When a C chord is configured with the notes in the order C G E, it is in open position, as the notes are placed further apart.

Close position triads are difficult to play on the lowest set of strings, due to the way the guitar is tuned. 

It's helpful to see all of the permutations on the fretboard, but be careful. If you're feeling any discomfort while playing these voicings for the first few times, try arpeggiating the chords (playing the notes one at a time). 

If you feel tension in your hand, shake it out, hanging your hand at your side, and try again.

###  1.1. <a name='Lesson3Overview'></a>Lesson 3 Overview
- one thing in all keys, all things in one key.
  - all things in one key, I'm talking about all of the chord qualities with the same route. If you take a concept and make it so that you're able to put all things in one key, one thing in all keys, then you really have it surrounded. 


 ###  1.2. <a name='Drop2Voicing-FourAdjacentStrings'></a>Drop2 Voicing - Four Adjacent Strings
- A seventh chord is `1 3 5 7` the drop 2 is `1 5 7 3`. `3` is an octave higher
- This works for:
  - C7,Cm7 CM7, Cm7b5 etc 

###  1.3. <a name='ReadingDrop2andtheSecondInversion'></a>Reading Drop2 and the Second Inversion
- Drop-2 voicings provide a solid foundation for nearly any harmonic situation, giving you voicings that fit well on four adjacent strings. Let's look at a drop-2 voicing that you may already know.
- ![](/Music/HowToPlayGuitarSpec/03-GuitarChordVoicings/uploads/W3/001.png)

- Let's find a systematic way that this voicing could be derived, working toward a comprehensive understanding of the drop 2 approach. C7 (C dominant 7) consists of a major triad with an added ♭7. Let's work on the principle of drop-2 to dominant 7 chords first, spelling a C7 in all inversions:

- Here is the C7 in all inversions notated from the chart above.

- Looking at the second inversion, let's take the second note from the top, and lower it an octave.

- ![](/Music/HowToPlayGuitarSpec/03-GuitarChordVoicings/uploads/W3/005.png)
- Formerly the second voice from the top, the C is now on the bottom, and we are now left with a C7 chord with the root in the bass. This is called a drop-2 voicing for C7. This shape is most frequently performed on the middle four strings and the top four strings.
- ![](/Music/HowToPlayGuitarSpec/03-GuitarChordVoicings/uploads/W3/006.png)
- This produces a shape that fits well under the hand on four adjacent strings. This configuration of notes is much more guitar-friendly than a close-position voicing, in which three consecutive third intervals produce a shape that is virtually unplayable on the guitar neck. Here are three possibilities for this voicing. Try playing each one.

###  1.4. <a name='OneThinginAllKeys'></a>One Thing in All Keys
- One thing in all keys, in this case, would refer to taking this C7 voicing and moving it around to all twelve keys. 
- All things in one key would refer to taking this voicing and morphing it into different chord qualities. C7 can be reshaped to give you Cmaj7, Cmin7, Cmin7(♭5), or Cdim7 through alteration of the third, seventh, and fifth of the chord.

###  1.6. <a name='Drop2ChordQualities'></a>Drop2 Chord Qualities
- Based on Major scale 3rd and 5th share the same string, so a solution is take the 3rd one octave higher.
- Now, this formula will really help you a lot, like a C7 sus four C, F, it's hard to reach that one, G, B flat. So I take the f and put it up an octave within reach and where my fingers are and this becomes this and gives us a C7 sus

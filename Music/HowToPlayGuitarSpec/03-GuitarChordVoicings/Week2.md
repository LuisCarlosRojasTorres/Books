##  1. <a name='BarreandPowerChords'></a>Barre and Power Chords

###  1.1. <a name='Lesson2Overview'></a>Lesson 2 Overview
- Power chords: Root + fifth + root
  - Not suspeded, not triad
  - Powerful 
- Tone is everithing, time and tone are essential elements of every guitarist performance. 


###  1.2. <a name='PowerChords-BigSoundTwoTones'></a>Power Chords - Big Sound Two Tones
- Power chords are sometimes notated as a root name followed by a 5 (like the diagrams below). They include just the root and 5th of the chord, but no 3rd or 7th. Often, the root is repeated on top as well. Here's a C5, found in two positions on the neck.

- **Many Variations**
  - Why are there so many variations? 
  - That's a hard one to answer, other than to say that guitarists have been finding their own way to play the instrument for hundreds of years. Some song hooks are written around a particular voicing; some players gravitate toward certain sounds. None of these voicings are "wrong" or even less sophisticated than the voicings we've been developingâ€”they're just different sounds. 
  - Hopefully, this course is introducing some new sounds that haven't occurred to you before, and you'll put them into your musical vocabulary.


###  1.6. <a name='Groovingwithabackingtrack'></a>Grooving with a backing track
- The longer the string the richest the sound
- rhythm and time feel are the true international language
- if we can make the metronome dance, if we can make the metronome sound like a great drummer, we're well on our way to sounding great ourselves.

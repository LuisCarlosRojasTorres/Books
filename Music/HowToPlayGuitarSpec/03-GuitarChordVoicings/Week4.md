- Diatonic chords involve taking the 7th chords like a B flat major 7 [SOUND] and just following right up the diatonic chords of the key. 
- Three types of substitutions that you can use. One of the most interesting aspects of guitar voicings on the guitar involves substitutions

- Many guitarists who are interested in working on chord voicings are also interested in learning about chord substitutions. Very frequently, chord substitutions are unnecessary, as they say, “if it isn’t broken, you don’t need to fix it.” But, when you’re composing, or working on an introduction or ending, it’s useful to have some other options.
- There are two basic types of chord substitution:
    - embellishment of an existing chord
  - replacing one chord with another
- We will be looking at some basic examples of each.

#### Embellishment of an Existing Chord
**Minor 7 Subbing for Major 7 Voicings**  
Here’s a very fundamental way to embellish major 7 or minor 7 chords:

Where:
- CMaj7: C E G B, 
- Em7: E G B D is composed of the last three notes which is similar to CMaj9 with no root.
- You’ll notice that the chord built from the third of the major 7 chord is lacking the root of the original chord. If a bassist is playing the root of the chord, however, the listener will be hearing a fuller, more harmonically rich sound. Listen to the example below.

###  1.4. <a name='SubstituteChordsforMajor7Chords'></a>Substitute Chords for Major 7 Chords
Here are the substitute chords for major 7 chords in all twelve keys, allowing you to imply major 9 sounds, wherever you may want them.

- This next set of etudes is set up to make it so that it'll be automatic for you to play a minor 7 voicing above a major 7 to give a major 9 sound.

###  1.6. <a name='ReplacingOneChordwithAnother:DominantChordsandSub-Five'></a>Replacing One Chord with Another: Dominant Chords and Sub-Five
- Let's start by playing the two chords we will be working with, C7 and G♭7.

![](/Music/HowToPlayGuitarSpec/03-GuitarChordVoicings/uploads/W4/004.png)

Notice that C7 and G♭7 share two notes: E and B♭. 

![](/Music/HowToPlayGuitarSpec/03-GuitarChordVoicings/uploads/W4/005.png)

The root and the fifth are entirely different, but C7 and G♭7 share the same ♭7th and 3rd—although each note’s role is reversed. See below:

![](/Music/HowToPlayGuitarSpec/03-GuitarChordVoicings/uploads/W4/006.png)

The most important notes of any seventh chord are its “guide tones,” the chord’s 3rd and 7th. Let’s look at C7 and G♭7. So, even though C7 and G♭7 only share two notes, because they share "guide tones", they can be used to replace each other. Listen to the example below and try it for yourself!

- Here are sub-five dominant chord substitutions, presented in all 12 keys.

- The C Major and D minor triads together contains `C`, `D`,`E`,`F`,`G`, and `A`. 
  - This is called `The Gospel Scale`
- Two have another sound you can play the C major triad as follows:
  - First Cminor: `C D# G`
  - Then CMajor: `C E G`	
  - So play the `D# E` transition
- The Gospel Scale `R23456` is a Major Pentatonic Scale `R2356` plus a `4`

##  1. <a name='ToneProductionEssentials'></a>Tone Production Essentials

###  1.1. <a name='Timbre'></a>Timbre
- Timbre aka the tone quality of your guitar.
  - Pick close to the neck: darker sound
  - Pick close to the middle: round sound
  - Pick close to the brigde: metal sound
  - Point end: clear
  - Round end: darker
  - Pick parallel to string: brighter
  - Angle: the bigger the warmer
###  1.2. <a name='PickandTone'></a>Pick and Tone
- Pick Shape
  - Let's explore how the pick itself can give us different variations in tone, enhancing our ability to create a diverse set of textures for playing in a group.
  - A typical guitar pick is designed to give two different playing surfaces, the "pointed" end and the "rounded" end. Both surfaces give vastly different tones, yet many guitarists settle on one only, which is often based on comfort and habit.
- Exploring Pick Shape and Tone Change
  ![Picks](/Music/HowToPlayGuitarSpec/04-GuitarPerformanceTechniques/uploads/w3/W3001.png)
  - Experiment with the different tones your pick has to offer by playing a pentatonic scale up and down. Start first with the pointed end of the pick, then the rounded end. How does this affect the tone of your guitar? 
  - As you can hear, the tonal change is rather large! The pointed end gives you more attack and more treble frequencies, while the rounded end gives you less attack and more bass frequencies. A good knowledge of how it can give you tonal variation will make you much more versatile in a group setting. Many guitarists look for amps and pedals to change their sound but your main tool for tonal shaping is your PICK and how you use it!
  - The thickness of your pick also has a large effect on tone. Thinner picks will usually give more treble and less bass, while thicker picks will fatten up the tone with more mids and lows. Consider having a light, medium, and heavy pick in your practice sessions to experiment with the different tonal characteristics of each.
- Pick Angle
  - We will now focus on the most dramatic tonal shaping aspect of playing with a pick: the pick angle. The way that you angle the guitar pick will give you a lot of variety tonally.
  - We begin by playing a passage straight across the strings with no angle. Notice that the tone is fairly bright. 
  ![Parallel](/Music/HowToPlayGuitarSpec/04-GuitarPerformanceTechniques/uploads/w3/W3002.png) 
  - Now, gradually angle the pick towards the ground and notice the tonal change. 
  ![Angle](/Music/HowToPlayGuitarSpec/04-GuitarPerformanceTechniques/uploads/w3/W3003.png) 
  - Notice how the tone thickens as you angle the pick. If you do not hear the change right away, experiment with it until you begin to hear a change. By simply angling the pick, you can play a passage that goes from bright to dark without touching any of the knobs on your guitar or amp!
  - Your ability to blend with the band with the appropriate timbre is essential for the music to truly shine. Consider the elements of tone production using the pick and its many variables as a powerful tool that you can use to expand your musical palette. 


###  1.3. <a name='Dynamics'></a>Dynamics
- Start to play softly and increase the volume then start playing loudly and go soft.


###  1.4. <a name='DynamicsActivity'></a>Dynamics Activity
- Let's start by exploring your guitar's dynamic range unplugged.
  1. First, hit the guitar hard and play loud! You will notice that the guitar buzzes and frets out and often goes sharp at that volume.
  2. Now do the same thing again and bring the volume down a little bit (we are still playing loud) until you reach a nice tone and the guitar is still in tune. You have just discovered the top level of dynamics that your guitar can play, while still delivering a good tone and intonation.
  3. Hitting the guitar as hard as you can is not necessarily the loudest point you should play. You must learn the top dynamic range and how it feels to play at that level, knowing that if you must play louder in the band, then you will need turn up the amp. Over-playing will not give you more volume, it will just ruin your tone and make you go out of tune.
- Now explore your guitar's quiet dynamic aspects.
  1. Play a note as quietly as you possibly can. Try to play so quietly that you can barely hear anything. You will notice that this takes thought and it requires that you listen closely to what you are playing.
  2. Continue to listen closely by bringing the volume up until it is a full note, but as quietly as you can physically play. You have just discovered the lowest level of dynamics that your guitar can play. This may take some time to develop, as quiet dynamics require a great deal of control and critical listening to achieve.
- Finally, we will explore how to link your lowest dynamic to your highest. A great place to start is with a scale. Let's use the C major scale starting with the root on the 8th fret of the 6th string.
![Tab](/Music/HowToPlayGuitarSpec/04-GuitarPerformanceTechniques/uploads/w3/W3004.png) 
  1. Play a two-octave major scale up and down. As you are ascending, go from your lowest dynamic—remembering that it is barely audible—up to your highest dynamic.
  2. Once you reach the top note of the two-octave scale, begin descending the pitches while simultaneously lowering the dynamics until you end where you began: quiet. This is an excellent way to learn how to control your dynamic range with your hands and ears linked together.
  3. As you ascend and descend, focus on changing the dynamics gradually over the scale. This way you will not have to suddenly and drastically change the dynamic as you reach the end points.
-Once you become aware of dynamics and practice them in this way for an extended period of time, this deep listening will make it's way into everything that you play. It will start to become the way that you naturally play the guitar and you will begin to notice things about your guitar, picking, and your technique that you never noticed before. You will become a better listener, and ultimately a better guitarist and musician.

- For this project, you will compose your own melody over the backing track provided. Your melody should use the Dorian scale or A minor pentatonic scale. As you record your melody, make sure that you are showcasing dynamic contours, timbre variations and note duration. When you have created a recording you are happy with, post the link below so that your peers can provide you with feedback.
- Your recording should:
  - Show clear examples of timbre changes using pick placement and angle.
  - Show dynamic contours in your phrases.
  - Show different ways that you can apply vibrato.
  - Play with great intonation.
- A Dorian Scale:

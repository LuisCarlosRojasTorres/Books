**Gratitude Exercise**
Warming up your mind is simple! Take a moment before you play to do the following mental exercise. This is called "Gratitude"

1. Grab your guitar!
2. Ask yourself this simple question: What am I grateful for?
3. Repeat.

How do you feel?
You feel really good right now, don't you? Perhaps you said this to yourself: 

> "Wow, I'm grateful to have this guitar. This is a nice guitar pick that I am holding in my hand. I am lucky to have an amp that works. I am practicing guitar right now!" 

Perhaps you really got into this exercise and went deeper into what you are grateful for in areas outside of music. Take this as far as you want or need. The further you go, the better your warm-up session will be. I cannot think of a better mindset to be in when I walk into a rehearsal or gig.

**Visualizing your performance**
Visualization is a powerful tool for any performer and it can also be an excellent way to warm up the mind. Take the following steps to visualize the outcome that you would like to achieve as you prepare for a performance. Take a moment to close your eyes and visualize the following things:

Visualize your hands moving easily and smoothly as you play guitar.

Hear the way your guitar sounds, playing the phrases effortlessly with a great sound and groove.

Visualize playing challenging passages. Go over each note with specific detail. Visualize where your finger must move on the fretboard as well as what the notes sound like in your head. Be very specific in your mind about exact fret locations. Try to sing the passages in your head while visualizing your hand movements.

Visualize yourself playing in your band. Are you standing or sitting? What guitar are you playing? What does the tone sound like? Look around the room and imagine all of the musicians playing with you. Visualize playing each of the different songs. Try to imagine yourself playing challenging sections in the pieces perfectly.

Basic Arm and Hand Stretches
Moving your body and basic stretching is a great way to begin the process of playing. Start by shaking out your arms and hands. Getting the blood moving in your body is essential. Below are a few diagrams of the basic stretching exercises discussed in the previous video. 

These stretches help you warm up and ultimately avoid injury from hours of playing onstage.

**Exercise Stretch 1**
1. Straighten your arms out with your palms up. 
2. You should feel a stretch through your forearms.

**Exercise Stretch 2**
1. Interlock your fingers and push your arms straight out, palms away from you. 
2. You should feel a stretch through the top of your forearms.

**Exercise Stretch 3**
1. Use your left hand to gentle grasp and push back the fingers of your right hand. 
2. You should feel a stretch through the palm of your right hand.

**Picking Hand**
As demonstrated in the previous videos, the following exercises can be used to warm up your picking and fretting hands. 

This simple exercise using alternate picking will work wonders for your pick control. Just like the video, play the exercise first with eighth notes, then sixteenth notes, and finally with triplets.

The goal of this exercise is to get your picking hand used to playing in tempo. Tempo is the most challenging aspect to control when you are not warmed up. Control of fine motor skills will give you the detail that you need in order to play with great time. Sounding great in a band requires that you play with great time.

This alternate picking exercise gets your hands used to playing in tempo. Pay close attention to your time accuracy as you play. Notice any small imperfections in your tempo and work through them until you are able to play effortlessly.

You may find that on certain days you will play this exercise for a longer period of time, some days you will play it for a shorter period of time. 

1. Eighth Notes
First, play a single note in tempo with alternate picking until you gain control of your picking hand. In the first example we will focus on playing eighth notes. Enjoy the simplicity of this movement! It is meant to wake up your hand, so complex patterns are not needed at the beginning. Focus on your hand, and enjoy the process of getting in control of your movements.

2. Sixteenth Notes
In the second example we will play a single note with sixteenth notes. It is a similar exercise, but by playing a different rhythm, you will have to adjust your picking slightly to play the exercise.

3. Eighth Notes Triplets
In the third example we will play the exercise with eighth note triplets.

**Fretting Hand** 
Now let's activate the fretting hand with these exercises. We will play the same right-hand exercise as above, but now we will use different fingers on the fretting hand for each beat and cycle through them as we play in tempo. We are gently warming up the fretting hand with this exercise, so you should keep the hand movements relatively slow. This is a great way to get your fretting hand ready to play more complex passages. 

1. First, play a single note with the eighth note rhythm in tempo with alternate picking. This time, focus on your left hand, cycling through your four fingers, using a different finger on each new beat. 

2. Then, do the same exercise with sixteenth notes. Focus on staying in tempo and warming up your fretting hand.

3. Finally, do the same exercise with eighth note triplets.


Notice how it feels to play the different rhythms. 

Notice how your hand has to adjust to play these different rhythms. 

Notice how these changes affect your warm-up!

Below is the notation and backing tracks for the Two-Octave Chromatic Exercise used in the video to synchronize your picking and fretting hands.

To play the exercise, you will begin with the chromatic scale across the fretboard. This involves using alternate picking while simultaneously activating all of your fretting hand fingers. Each string will have four notes, each played with a separate finger. 

Feel free to use either the backing track with guitar or without to practice this exercise. Make sure that you are holding each note to its full value and that you are staying with the metronome. If you are having difficulties, start slow and eventually increase your tempo.

Warming up in tempo is a great way to prepare for a performance. Playing with a consistent tempo is a key factor in developing technical control of your instrument. The use of a metronome or backing track as you warm up gives you a solid context to build your technique.

**Metronome**
When warming up, the metronome is your best friend. It is clearly a great tool to use for improving your time accuracy, but there is another important aspect to point out: having a metronome clicking helps to maintain your focus. Without the metronome, you may occasionally find yourself playing in and out of tempo, forgetting about your warm-up and playing different parts of random songs, starting, stopping, and then noodling around on the instrument without a purpose. 

The metronome is a reminder that you are doing something specific. 

As it clicks, it reminds you that you have a job to do, something to accomplish. Turn on the metronome and notice how it directs you to your task, inviting you to play with it!

**Triad Warm-ups**
Below are the Triad exercises demonstrated in the videos. They are designed to help warm up your hands and build your technique. Remember, we are working towards playing with a group and our goal is to get our technique feeling comfortable for all of the musical tasks that come our way.

A warm-up exercise using triad arpeggios is an excellent piece to play while warming up. The exercise involves playing triad arpeggios up and down the neck in twelve keys. This is a great pattern to synchronize your picking and fretting hand. It is also very useful for alternate picking arpeggios, a challenging technique that will help to free you from technical restraints.

Follow these steps to use the Triad Warm-ups:

1. Practice through each of the four exercises starting with the easiest, the Minor Triads. 
2. Start at a slower tempo if you are struggling and slowly increase your speed as the exercises become easier.
3. When you are ready, play the warm-up along with the backing tracks provided.

Backing Tracks with an example guitar playing have been included as a reference.

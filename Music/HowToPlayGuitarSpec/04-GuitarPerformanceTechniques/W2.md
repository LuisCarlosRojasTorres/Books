###  1.1. <a name='ReadingSingingWhatYouPlayandPlayingWhatYouSing'></a>Reading Singing What You Play and Playing What You Sing

- **What are GOOD EARS**
  - When guitarists have "good ears" it means that they are able to find any note quickly on the guitar. They are able to 
    - determine whether a piece of music is major or minor in tonality. 
    - determine the key of the song quickly. 
    - copy phrases from other members of the ensemble in real time. 
    - use their ears to make quick musical decisions, making them a valuable part of the ensemble.
- **Singing what you PLAY**
  - In order to develop "good ears," you must learn to connect what you hear in your head to what you play with your hands. The first step is activating your voice. Sing everything that you play on the guitar until your mind and your hands become one single musical instrument.
    1. Start by playing a single note. 
    2. Now sing the note. 
  - Were you able to match the pitch with your voice? If the answer is yes, move on to a new pitch, then start singing and playing melodies simultaneously.
  - If the answer was no, this means that you are not used to activating your voice while playing music. Play the note again, and try to match the pitch with your voice. If you are having trouble, ask yourself, "is my voice too high or too low?" Adjust your voice to match the note that you are playing.
  - With this exercise, we are not attempting to be vocalists, we are simply trying to match the pitch with your voice. Once you have learned to sing the notes that you are playing through repetition, you are ready to move on to the next step.


- **Playing What you SING**
- Next let's look at the steps of playing what you sing.
  1. Start by singing a simple, short melody.
  2. Now play that melody. The most important step is to match the first pitch. Find the first note that you sang and duplicate it on the guitar.
  3. Now try to play the short melody that you sang. Use your musical memory to sing the melody again.
  4. Play and name the first note on the guitar, then sing and play simultaneously until you have completed the melody.
- On the guitar, this requires that you are able to hear and visualize intervals on the guitar neck. Practicing singing and playing is the best way to internalize intervals on the instrument.
###  1.2. <a name='PlayingByEarExercises'></a>Playing By Ear Exercises
- The following exercises are a great way to improve your ear. If you struggle at first, keep trying! Do the exercises every day and you will start to see an improvement.
- **Exercise #1 Play then Sing**
  - Play the following notes, one at a time on your guitar. Sing each note. Do not move on until you have accurately matched the pitch with your voice. If the note is out of your range, simply play it up or down an octave.
  - ![](/Music/HowToPlayGuitarSpec/04-GuitarPerformanceTechniques/uploads/w2/W2001.png)
  - Now try these notes
  - ![](/Music/HowToPlayGuitarSpec/04-GuitarPerformanceTechniques/uploads/w2/W2002.png)
  - Is it getting better? Repetition is the key. We must repeat this process many times to gain fluency.
  - Now we will play short four-note phrases. Play each example individually. For example, take the notes in example 1 and play them on the guitar. After you have played the phrase, sing the phrase. Now, play and sing the phrase simultaneously. Repeat this process for all eight examples.
  - ![](/Music/HowToPlayGuitarSpec/04-GuitarPerformanceTechniques/uploads/w2/W2003.png)
  - **Exercise #2 Sing then play**
    - Listen to the following phrases. Sing each phrase. Rewind it several times if you need to, but make sure to sing the pitches accurately before attempting to play it. Now play the phrase. If you cannot play it at first, sing the first note and match it on your guitar, then move on to the second note. Move through the phrase until you can play it correctly on your guitar.
    - Sing then Play Example #1:
    - [example001](/Music/HowToPlayGuitarSpec/04-GuitarPerformanceTechniques/uploads/w2/example001.mp3)
    - Now let's try another phrase. Remember that we are not guessing, we are deliberately singing an exact pitch and finding that pitch on the guitar. We want to connect the fingers with the musical mind to strengthen this skill. Guessing by putting your fingers on random notes on the fretboard or randomly moving around to find a pitch does not work. We have to focus our listening on exact pitches with deliberate hand motions to find the sound.
    - Sing then Play Example #2:

###  1.4. <a name='ReadingTranscribingPhrasesByEar'></a>Reading Transcribing Phrases By Ear

1. Sing the notes and rhythms
   - When learning a phrase from a recording, the first step is to be able to sing the notes and rhythms. Listen to the phrase, rewind it, and listen again. Repeat this process until you can hear the phrase in your mind. You should be able to sing the phrase along with the recording, as well as sing it in your mind without the recording playing. If the phrase is long, start by breaking it down into smaller sections.
   - If the music is at a tempo that feels difficult to sing, I recommend getting software that slows the audio down. This can be very helpful, even for experienced musicians. Often, slowing down the audio allows you to relax and hear the details of the music at your own pace. There are several options for software, and most of them allow you to set start and end times for the phrase, allowing you to loop the audio. This can be very helpful, eliminating the need to press "stop," "rewind," etc. If you do not have this type of software, I highly recommend getting it.
2. Learn the phrase note by note 
  - Once you have the phrase memorized in your mind, then it is time to start figuring it out, note by note. As you begin learning the phrase note by note, focus on one note at a time. You already learned to sing it, so half of the work is already done!
   - Isolate the first note. Sing it. Find it on the guitar. If you are not able to do this the first time, try again. Keep trying until you get it. This may take you only one time, this may take you ten times or more. Every time you go through this process you are improving.
3. Play the phrase with the recording 
   - Go through each note in the phrase until you are certain that you have everything correct. Spend time playing along with the recording, playing the phrase exactly as you hear it. Listen critically to your guitar and the recording simultaneously, making sure that you are exactly in sync. A general rule that I go by is that if something sounds wrong or slightly "off," it probably is! Slow down the audio a little more to make sure that you have the notes down exactly as it is on the recording. Again, this requires detailed listening, not passive listening.
   - Go through these steps until you are able to play the intended music. At the beginning this may take longer than you expect. It's OK, you are slowly building your hearing muscle and it will not happen overnight. This is a process that grows with each phrase that you learn by ear.

###  1.6. <a name='ReadingTranscribingChordsbyEar'></a>Reading Transcribing Chords by Ear

- Transcribing chords by ear is more complex than transcribing a phrase because you now have to hear individual notes in the context of a chord. With the following approach, the process will become easier.
- Steps to Transcribing Chords
  1. Find a recording: Step one is to find a recording of the chord progression that you would like to learn. Perhaps it is a chord progression that you must learn for your band, but there is no lead sheet or chord chart available, so you must learn it yourself.
  2. Isolate one chord: It is important to isolate a chord by itself. Play the chord and stop the recording right away. Do this several times to get your ears accustomed to the sound. 
  3. Sing the lowest note: Next, play the recording and sing the lowest note along with the recording. Did you get it right? Does the note that you are singing match perfectly with the recording? If not, repeat this process as many times as it takes to get the note right.
  4. Find the lowest note on your guitar: Now find the note on your guitar. Sing the note and search the guitar neck until you are playing the note that you are singing. Remember, there are no shortcuts with this, just keep listening, singing, and finding the notes on the guitar until you are successful.
  5. Find the highest note: Next listen for the highest note in the chord voicing. Follow the same process until you can successfully sing and play the note on the guitar. 
  6. Play both notes: Once you have found this top note, play both the bass note and the top note together. This will be the framework for the chord that you are trying to learn. Think of it as writing the beginning and ending of a story. You've got the most important parts, you just have to figure out the details.
  7. Sing any of the other notes: Now try to sing any of the other notes that you can hear in the chord voicing. Try to latch onto another note other than the bass note or the top note. Try to sing and play this note. After you are confident with this, play all three notes together.
  8. Play with the recording: Play the chord along with the recording and listen critically to assess whether or not it is correct. This may take several attempts to be sure. Follow this process until you cannot go further with the chord. After you cannot hear any other notes in the chord, if done correctly, you will now have the chord under your fingers. Make sure to write it down! 
- That took some effort, so getting it down on paper will solidify your efforts! While it may be tempting to consult the Internet to find notation, tab, or instructional videos for the song that you are trying to learn, I do not recommend this. Learn it on your own to develop your skill to its full potential. The Internet can be your friend in many ways when learning to play music, but don't abuse it when you are working on ear training.

###  1.7. <a name='ReadingRecognizingChordTypes'></a>Reading Recognizing Chord Types
- Learning how to recognize chord types is one of the most useful skills to develop your ear training. When you are transcribing chords, there may be moments when you arrive at the bass note and top note, but you are still having trouble with finding other notes in the chord. Having the ability to recognize basic chord voicings for all of the chord types will help you in making educated guesses about what the chord could be.
- How do you recognize chord types? First, you need to know them and be able to play them fluently. They have to be a natural part of your musical vocabulary in order to recognize them in different contexts. The following chart has a list of the most important chords to be able to play and recognize in modern music. This is the essential, must know list of chords. With this list of chords internalized, your musicianship will rise to a new level.
- **Essential 7th Chords**
  - These chords are arranged first with the root on the 6th string and then with the root on the 5th string. Chords with the root on the 6th string are drop 3 voicing and chords with the root on the 5th string are drop 2 voicing. These are the most common 7th chord voicing's used on the guitar.
  ![](/Music/HowToPlayGuitarSpec/04-GuitarPerformanceTechniques/uploads/w2/W2004.png)
  - Now it is time to internalize the sound of each chord. A great way to do this is to strum each chord type along with a metronome or drum loop. Try the 6th string root chords as well as the 5th string root chords. The idea is to play these chords frequently in order to internalize the sound
  - Chord Recognition Exercise: The following exercise is a great way to start internalizing these chords.
    1. In tempo, play through all of the chord voicings. Each measure will have a 5th string root voicing and a 6th string root voicing. 
    2. Call out the name of the chord as you are playing it. This will help you learn the name of the chord and, more importantly, the sound of each chord. 
  - Over time, you will be able to recognize any chordal harmony when you hear it on a recording.

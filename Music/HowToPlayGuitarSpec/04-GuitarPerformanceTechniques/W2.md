###  1.1. <a name='ReadingSingingWhatYouPlayandPlayingWhatYouSing'></a>Reading Singing What You Play and Playing What You Sing

- **What are GOOD EARS**
  - When guitarists have "good ears" it means that they are able to find any note quickly on the guitar. They are able to 
    - determine whether a piece of music is major or minor in tonality. 
    - determine the key of the song quickly. 
    - copy phrases from other members of the ensemble in real time. 
    - use their ears to make quick musical decisions, making them a valuable part of the ensemble.
- **Singing what you PLAY**
  - In order to develop "good ears," you must learn to connect what you hear in your head to what you play with your hands. The first step is activating your voice. Sing everything that you play on the guitar until your mind and your hands become one single musical instrument.
    1. Start by playing a single note. 
    2. Now sing the note. 
  - Were you able to match the pitch with your voice? If the answer is yes, move on to a new pitch, then start singing and playing melodies simultaneously.
  - If the answer was no, this means that you are not used to activating your voice while playing music. Play the note again, and try to match the pitch with your voice. If you are having trouble, ask yourself, "is my voice too high or too low?" Adjust your voice to match the note that you are playing.
  - With this exercise, we are not attempting to be vocalists, we are simply trying to match the pitch with your voice. Once you have learned to sing the notes that you are playing through repetition, you are ready to move on to the next step.


- **Playing What you SING**
- Next let's look at the steps of playing what you sing.
  1. Start by singing a simple, short melody.
  2. Now play that melody. The most important step is to match the first pitch. Find the first note that you sang and duplicate it on the guitar.
  3. Now try to play the short melody that you sang. Use your musical memory to sing the melody again.
  4. Play and name the first note on the guitar, then sing and play simultaneously until you have completed the melody.
- On the guitar, this requires that you are able to hear and visualize intervals on the guitar neck. Practicing singing and playing is the best way to internalize intervals on the instrument.
###  1.2. <a name='PlayingByEarExercises'></a>Playing By Ear Exercises
- The following exercises are a great way to improve your ear. If you struggle at first, keep trying! Do the exercises every day and you will start to see an improvement.
- **Exercise #1 Play then Sing**
  - Play the following notes, one at a time on your guitar. Sing each note. Do not move on until you have accurately matched the pitch with your voice. If the note is out of your range, simply play it up or down an octave.

  - Now try these notes

  - Is it getting better? Repetition is the key. We must repeat this process many times to gain fluency.
  - Now we will play short four-note phrases. Play each example individually. For example, take the notes in example 1 and play them on the guitar. After you have played the phrase, sing the phrase. Now, play and sing the phrase simultaneously. Repeat this process for all eight examples.
  - ![](/Music/HowToPlayGuitarSpec/04-GuitarPerformanceTechniques/uploads/w2/W2003.png)
  - **Exercise #2 Sing then play**
    - Listen to the following phrases. Sing each phrase. Rewind it several times if you need to, but make sure to sing the pitches accurately before attempting to play it. Now play the phrase. If you cannot play it at first, sing the first note and match it on your guitar, then move on to the second note. Move through the phrase until you can play it correctly on your guitar.
    - Sing then Play Example #1:
    - [example001](/Music/HowToPlayGuitarSpec/04-GuitarPerformanceTechniques/uploads/w2/example001.mp3)
    - Now let's try another phrase. Remember that we are not guessing, we are deliberately singing an exact pitch and finding that pitch on the guitar. We want to connect the fingers with the musical mind to strengthen this skill. Guessing by putting your fingers on random notes on the fretboard or randomly moving around to find a pitch does not work. We have to focus our listening on exact pitches with deliberate hand motions to find the sound.
    - Sing then Play Example #2:

###  1.4. <a name='ReadingTranscribingPhrasesByEar'></a>Reading Transcribing Phrases By Ear

1. Sing the notes and rhythms
   - When learning a phrase from a recording, the first step is to be able to sing the notes and rhythms. Listen to the phrase, rewind it, and listen again. Repeat this process until you can hear the phrase in your mind. You should be able to sing the phrase along with the recording, as well as sing it in your mind without the recording playing. If the phrase is long, start by breaking it down into smaller sections.
   - If the music is at a tempo that feels difficult to sing, I recommend getting software that slows the audio down. This can be very helpful, even for experienced musicians. Often, slowing down the audio allows you to relax and hear the details of the music at your own pace. There are several options for software, and most of them allow you to set start and end times for the phrase, allowing you to loop the audio. This can be very helpful, eliminating the need to press "stop," "rewind," etc. If you do not have this type of software, I highly recommend getting it.
2. Learn the phrase note by note 
  - Once you have the phrase memorized in your mind, then it is time to start figuring it out, note by note. As you begin learning the phrase note by note, focus on one note at a time. You already learned to sing it, so half of the work is already done!
   - Isolate the first note. Sing it. Find it on the guitar. If you are not able to do this the first time, try again. Keep trying until you get it. This may take you only one time, this may take you ten times or more. Every time you go through this process you are improving.
3. Play the phrase with the recording 
   - Go through each note in the phrase until you are certain that you have everything correct. Spend time playing along with the recording, playing the phrase exactly as you hear it. Listen critically to your guitar and the recording simultaneously, making sure that you are exactly in sync. A general rule that I go by is that if something sounds wrong or slightly "off," it probably is! Slow down the audio a little more to make sure that you have the notes down exactly as it is on the recording. Again, this requires detailed listening, not passive listening.
   - Go through these steps until you are able to play the intended music. At the beginning this may take longer than you expect. It's OK, you are slowly building your hearing muscle and it will not happen overnight. This is a process that grows with each phrase that you learn by ear.

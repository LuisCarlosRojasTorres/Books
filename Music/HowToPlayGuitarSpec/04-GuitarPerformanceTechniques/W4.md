###  1.2. <a name='Knowyourgear'></a>Know your gear
- When you are playing in an ensemble, bringing the right guitar, pedals, and amp for the gig is essential. Knowing the details of your setup and how it works and sounds at different volume levels will be an important factor in your playing experience.
- Here are some examples of gear by two well-respected guitarists:
  - Steve Vai's Gear:

  - Joe Bonamassa's Gear:
  - ![JoeBonamassa](/Music/HowToPlayGuitarSpec/04-GuitarPerformanceTechniques/uploads/w4/W4003.jpeg) 
- **Practicing with an amplifier** will ensure that you are comfortable with your sound when you transition to an ensemble setting.
  - the guitar responds in a different way with an amp than it does acoustically. 
  - The dynamic response is different. 
  - You will notice that you have to work a little harder to play softly on an electric guitar. The louder that you play with an amp, the harder it will be to play softly.
- **Preparing your Guitar Tones**
  - try to find a space where you can turn up your guitar rig to dial in your tones. This will save you a lot of time and energy when you arrive to your performance. 
  - If your rig is dialed in at speaking volumes, you may find that it is too bright or too boomy when you turn up the volume. This is due to something called the Fletcher Munson Curve. It shows that the ear hears different frequencies at different levels. 
    - In short, the midrange frequencies will sound more prominent at lower volumes, and the low and high frequencies will sound more prominent at higher volumes. 
  - Because of this, it is essential to experience the sound of your equipment at performance levels to really know your gear.
###  1.3. <a name='PrePerformanceWarmUp'></a>PrePerformance WarmUp
1. Review your Music
   - review your music to make sure that you have it memorized.
   - Go over any ensemble passages that may still be giving you trouble
2. Practice with the Recorded Music
   - If you are in a band that has recorded your music, get a mix of the recording without the guitar track. Instant backing tracks! 
   - It is a great idea to simulate the performance along with backing tracks at home.
     - Set up your amp and effects just as you would at the performance. 
   -  Learn to use software to create your own backing tracks.
3. Simulate the Performance 
   - If you stand while performing, stand up and play when you are practicing. Do everything that you would normally do in a performance, only at home 
     - This will simulate the experience and give you a level of preparedness that you would not normally have

###  1.4. <a name='ListeningandBlendingOnStage'></a>Listening and Blending On Stage
- The best musicians are the best listeners. Remember that statement. It will be something to bring with you to every rehearsal, every gig, and every recording session. In fact, after realizing that detailed listening is one of the most important aspects of playing in an ensemble, I made a note that said LISTEN and I put it in my guitar case. Every time I opened my case, there was the sign: LISTEN. 
- I did this years ago, and it's still there, and I still acknowledge that I need to listen every time I take my guitar out of its case. This is a great thing to do for the performing guitarist. Make sure that you write it on a brightly colored piece of paper so you notice it every time that you get your guitar out to play. Another way to remind yourself to listen is to tape it to the top of your guitar. You will be able to see it, but it will be hidden from the audience. In fact, Dweezil Zappa liked the idea so much that he put his LISTEN sign right on his pedal board!
- Have you ever been in a band, played a guitar solo, then realized that you did not hear anything that anyone else played during your solo? If this has not happened to you, it probably will. 
- We must learn to recognize these moments. 
- They are important because it means that you are not paying attention to the other musicians, only yourself and your guitar playing. This does not work in a band. We must learn to split our listening between our own playing and what the rest of the band is playing.
- Listen Visually
  - One great way to practice listening is by looking at the instrument or player that you want to hear. What you listen to is often directed by what you look at. For example, if you look at the drums or the drummer while you are playing, you are more likely to lock into what they are playing. If you look at the vocalist, you are more likely to focus on your volume in relation to the vocalist. Try this technique the next time that you play music with someone. It is magical. 
  - You will instantly become a better listener by directing your visual focus.
  - Eventually you will learn to listen while looking at the other players as well as when you are looking at your guitar. This takes experience and the desire and awareness of listening in an ensemble. Try it out and notice how it changes your playing. 
- Lack of Listening Looks Bad
  - Blending your volume with the other musicians goes hand-in-hand with listening. Have you ever been to a performance and the guitar player was too loud? How about the drummer that overpowered the entire band? I think that all of us have experienced this! 
  - This is caused by a lack of listening. Either the musicians are not listening to each other, or the mix engineer is not listening to the overall blend of the music. If one, or both, of these people were actively listening with the intention of blending, this issue would not exist. You see, the solution is very simple to a musical problem that happens time and time again in live music. Play music with the intention of blending with detailed listening and the music will have a better sound. This is how great groups interact. Do you want this quality in your band? You should! It is all about listening!

- Using the backing track provided, record yourself performing the chordal accompaniment on the lead sheet, followed by an improvised guitar solo. 
- Upload your recording below to receive feedback from your peers.
  - Twelve-bar Blues in A Lead Sheet: [pdf](/Music/HowToPlayGuitarSpec/04-GuitarPerformanceTechniques/uploads/w4/L04_Final-assignment-Lead-Sheet.pdf) 
  - Twelve-bar Blues in A Backing Track: [backing track](/Music/HowToPlayGuitarSpec/04-GuitarPerformanceTechniques/uploads/w4/L04_Final-Assignment-BACKING-Track.mp3) 
  - Example [example](/Music/HowToPlayGuitarSpec/04-GuitarPerformanceTechniques/uploads/w4/L04_Final-Assignment-PRACTICE-Track.mp3) 
- When you have submitted your assignment below, you will complete a peer review for 3 of your classmates. 
- When doing the peer assessments, take time to carefully review each student's submissions. Consider how well the student was able to demonstrate their knowledge of the appropriate ensemble techniques and improvisational skills. Strive to provide your peers with specific, helpful, and kind feedback that will help them grow as an ensemble player.
- Please note that the recording is not required to sound like a professional recording.

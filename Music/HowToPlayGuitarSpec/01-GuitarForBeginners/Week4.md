- From G in 6th string to G in 1st string
  - 6th string: G G#
  - 5th string: A A# B C C#
  - 4th string: D D# E F F#
  - 3rd string: G G# A A# B
  - 2nd string: C C# D D#
  - 1st string: E F F# G
- Legato = sound smooth and connected
- Third Position: From G in 6th string to G in 1st string
  - 6th string: G G# A A#
  - 5th string: B C C# D D#
  - 4th string: E F F# G G#
  - 3rd string: A A# B C C#
  - 2nd string: D D# E F 
  - 1st string: F# G 
- Third Position: From G in 1st string to G in 6th string
  - 1st string: G 
  - 2nd string: Gb F E Eb D
  - 3rd string: Db C B Bb
  - 4th string: A Ab G Gb F

##  3. <a name='MajorScales'></a>Major Scales
 
###  3.1. <a name='MajorScales-1'></a>Major Scales
- A sequence of half steps (1fret) and whole steps (2 fret) is what creates a major scale.
  - For a `root` note the major scale sequence is: W W H H W W W H
  - For F: F G A Bb C D E F
    - Why Bb and not A#?: because the rule with major scales is that it must go to the next letter name.
- For C major scale:
  - 6: x
  - 5: 3
  - 4: 0 2 3
  - 3: 0 2 
  - 2: 0 1
  - 1: x

###  3.2. <a name='MoreonMajorScales'></a>More on Major Scales
- G Major scale
  - 6: 3 5
  - 5: 2 3 5
  - 4: 2 4 5
  - 3: 2 4 5  
  - 2: 3 5 
  - 1: 2 3
- The number of sharps and flats are how we determine what's called the key and the key signature.

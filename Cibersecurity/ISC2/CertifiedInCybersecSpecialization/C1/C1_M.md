### CIA Triads
non-repudiation: A term that has its roots in the legal world. To repudiate something means to deny something. We're saying non deniability. 

CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability) These are concepts that help shape our thinking. We can think of these almost as lenses that we can look through when we're working on a project or when we're considering the cybersecurity environment. 
It helps us maintain a balance between some of the different elements, some of which are often overlooked. If we think about cybersecurity, it may be that we go to things like encryption, firewalls, things that primarily perhaps relate to confidentiality in our mind, helping protect access to documents or information. But we have integrity and availability which carry equal weight just as important. As we look at each of these three concepts, I'd like you to think about the fact that they relate both to the logical or technical environment when we're working on computer systems, for example. But they also relate to a physical environment. 

We're using logical and technical as terms interchangeably to mean something computer-based and physical, something in the real-world, something tangible. 

- confidentiality. Confidentiality we're protecting an asset which could be hardware, software, or information. There on this slide we're talking about data. Protecting the data that needs controlled access, needs restricting. What we're trying to do is to prevent unauthorized access, authorized and unauthorized. Those two words imply a decision is taking place. 
  - Something is acting to control the access. Now this might be in the physical world. For example, a security guard or a receptionist determining who enters a building. It could be some authentication system or password, for example, checking that you have the authority. Or maybe file permissions. With confidentiality, we have just given some examples of confidentiality and how it impacts both the real-world and also that logical technical environment. 
- Integrity is about ensuring that the data has not been altered by somebody that has no authorization to do so. 
Again, we're talking about a decision point. Integrity is **about controlling change**. If we think about confidentiality as the ability to read, integrity, often we think about as writing or changing something. Let's change, it could be accidental. Accidental change. Because a disk has been corrupted, for example. That's an unauthorized change. 
There's no malicious notice in that necessarily it could be accidental, or it could be deliberate. It could be somebody looking to falsify a record, for example. What we're trying to do is to prevent unauthorized accidental or unauthorized to deliberate changes usually to our information, to our assets. It could be a software configuration, it could be a piece of hardware. But we're trying to control that change. Often again, we think about data. 
- availability: Here we're saying systems need to be available to those subjects, to those people that are authorized to use them. They have to be available when and where needed in the form and format that is required. It's not just about restricting access. The opposite is true as well. 
  - We need to provide access to those people that need the service. If you work in the health care environment, for instance, you might need patient data to provide effective treatment, and it might have to be provided quickly, effectively and in a particular format. These are concepts that help shape our thinking. 

### The CIA Triad
To define security, it has become common to use Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability, also known as the CIA triad. The purpose of these terms is to describe security using relevant and meaningful words that make security more understandable to management and users and define its purpose. 
- Confidentiality relates to permitting authorized access to information, while at the same time protecting information from improper disclosure. 
- Integrity is the property of information whereby it is recorded, used and maintained in a way that ensures its completeness, accuracy, internal consistency and usefulness for a stated purpose. 
- Availability means that systems and data are accessible at the time users need them. 

### Reading CIA Triad Deep Dive: Confidentiality
Confidentiality is a **difficult balance to achieve when many system users are guests or customers**, and it is not known if they are accessing the system from a compromised machine or vulnerable mobile application. So, the security professional’s obligation is to **regulate access—protect the data** that needs protection, yet permit access to authorized individuals.

**Personally Identifiable Information (PII)** is a term related to the area of confidentiality. It pertains to **any data about an individual that could be used to identify them**. Other terms related to confidentiality are **protected health information (PHI)** , which is information regarding one’s health status, and classified or sensitive information, which includes trade secrets, research, business plans and intellectual property.

Another useful definition is **sensitivity**, which is a **measure of the importance assigned to information by its owner**, or the purpose of denoting its need for protection. **Sensitive information is information that if improperly disclosed (confidentiality) or modified (integrity) would harm an organization or individual**. In many cases, sensitivity is related to the harm to external stakeholders; that is, people or organizations that may not be a part of the organization that processes or uses the information.

### Reading CIA Triad Deep Dive: Integrity
Integrity measures the **degree to which something is whole and complete**, internally consistent and correct. The concept of integrity applies to:
- information or data
- systems and processes for business operations
- organizations
- people and their actions

Data integrity: is the assurance that data has not been altered in an unauthorized manner. This requires the protection of the data in systems and during processing to ensure that it is free from improper modification, errors or loss of information and is recorded, used and maintained in a way that ensures its completeness. Data integrity **covers data in storage, during processing and while in transit**.

Information must be accurate, internally consistent and useful for a stated purpose. The **internal consistency of information ensures that information is correct on all related systems so that it is displayed and stored in the same way on all systems**. Consistency, as part of data integrity, requires that all instances of the data be identical in form, content and meaning.

System integrity refers to the maintenance of a known good configuration and expected operational function as the system processes the information. Ensuring integrity begins with an awareness of state, which is the current condition of the system. Specifically, this **awareness concerns the ability to document and understand the state of data or a system at a certain point, creating a baseline**. For example, a baseline can refer to the current state of the information—whether it is protected. Then, to preserve that state, the information must always continue to be protected through a transaction.

Going forward from that baseline, the integrity of the data or the system can always be ascertained by comparing the baseline with the current state. If the two match, then the integrity of the data or the system is intact; if the two do not match, then the integrity of the data or the system has been compromised. Integrity is a primary factor in the reliability of information and systems.

The need to safeguard information and system integrity may be dictated by laws and regulations. Often, it is dictated by the needs of the organization to access and use reliable, accurate information.

### Reading CIA Triad Deep Dive: Availability
Availability can be defined as 
1. timely and reliable access to information and the ability to use it
2. for authorized users, timely and reliable access to data and information services.

The core concept of **availability is that data is accessible to authorized users when and where it is needed and in the form and format required**. This does not mean that data or systems are available 100% of the time. Instead, the systems and data meet the requirements of the business for timely and reliable access.

S**ome systems and data are far more critical than others, so the security professional must ensure that the appropriate levels of availability are provided**. This requires consultation with the involved business to ensure that **critical systems are identified and available**. Availability is often associated with the term criticality, because it represents the importance an organization gives to data or an information system in performing its operations or achieving its mission.

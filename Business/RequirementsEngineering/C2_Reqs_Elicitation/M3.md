A last method of **artifact driven elicitation** is **knowledge reuse**. 
- Systems are rarely conceived from scratch. 
- Requirements, engineers and stakeholders tend to **reuse knowledge from past experience with other systems that are related to or they know**
   - it may refers to:
     - the **host organization**, 
     - to the **domain** in which the problem is rooted or 
     - to the **kind of problems that were experienced with similar systems**.
     - to the **kind of requirements that need to be considered for addressing such problems**.
   - As we gain knowledge we can:
     - **transpose our systems**. (looking for opportunities and instantiation, specialization and feature inheritance).
     - **reformat the vocabulary from the old system into the target system**.
     - **validate the result** and adapt it if necessary. And then integrate to the new system.

Adaptation and integration may require further elicitation and like everything else we have talked about in this lesson, you should be doing this in an iterative matter.

**Knowledge about similar organizations, domains and problem worlds helps us to reuse requirements, reuse assumptions, reuse domain properties and more.**

There are different types of reuse depending on the domain properties:
- Requirements taxonomies (image above) exist from many different domains to help us with our identification.
  - Nonfunctional requirements are the ities of our worke (security, usability, so on and so forth). They define the way that the software will satisfy the functional requirements. 
  - it is also how the sw should be developed.
- Taxonomies list specific classes to help us then characterize precisely for the product that we need. 
  - They help us think of corresponding classes that might usually be overlooked.
- Note that this example right here is only a subset of a full taxonomy.

- For each leaf node in an available requirements taxonomy, ask yourself, is there some requirement from this class that's in the system.
- By focusing on these sorts of questions early, you may also think of more functional requirements and also some alternatives for those requirements.
- Focusing on non functional requirements early, allows us to consider alternatives.
- Requirements taxonomies can be expanded with domain-independent knowledge, and also, domain-dependent knowledge. 
- specific requirements classes can be refined, and can conflict with each other.

- **Reuse of a metamodel** is another form of domain independent reuse.
- **Meta-modeling** is the construction of a collection of concepts (terms and stuff). 
 
In this case, we're acquiring knowledge about the organization or about the target system as an instantiation of the elements within the model. 

![alt text](M3_005.png)

- The idea is to reuse some abstraction of the domain. The elements of the abstract domain are defined once and for all. We then elicit portions of our system as specializations of those abstract elements.
- For example: in a library management system, an abstraction of a library management system domain might be the domain of resource management. 
  - Abstract: "A <user> may not use more than X <resource units> at a time"
  - Concret: "A patron may not use more than X book copies at a time"

![alt text](M3_006.png)

- One abstract domain may have multiple specializations, and a concrete domain may specialize multiple abstract domains.
- To increase the adequacy of reuse knowledge, the abstract domains should be made more structured and more accurate. 
  - For example, in a resource management setting, we might distinguish between returnable versus consumable resources. We might also compare between shareable items versus non shareable items.

- Elicitation effort however can be slightly reduced when **the target system is sufficiently close to node systems being reused**. 
  - Reused knowledge fragments may codify high quality requirements engineering done in the past. When you reuse this knowledge, reuse these taxonomies and this metadata. 
  - These can lead to better quality results through the guided processes. 
- On the annoying side though, **it can be very hard to find the right abstractions**. 
  - it's also **challenging to structure them and specify them appropriately for reusability**. 
  - When you're composing for multiple domains, there are usually consistency and compatibility problems, 
  - easy to spend way too much time validating the inappropriate features and performing tricky adaptations.

###  2.2. <a name='ReadingInferringdeclarativerequirementsspecificationsfromoperationalscenarios'></a>Reading Inferring declarative requirements specifications from operational scenarios
[LINK](http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.123.6403)

We learn, find patterns, and revise.  In this paper you'll read about moving scenarios into stronger forms.  

"Scenarios are increasingly recognized as an effective means for eliciting, validating, and documenting software requirements. This paper concentrates on the use of scenarios for requirements elicitation and explores the process of inferring formal specifications of goals and requirements from scenario descriptions. Scenarios are considered here as typical examples of system usage; they are provided in terms of sequences of interaction steps between the intended software and its environment. Such scenarios are in general partial, procedural, and leave required properties about the intended system implicit. In the end such properties need to be stated in explicit, declarative terms for consistency/completeness analysis to be carried out. A formal method is proposed for supporting the process of inferring specifications of system goals and requirements inductively from interaction scenarios provided by stakeholders. The method is based on a learning algorithm that takes scenarios as examples/counterexamples and generates a set of goal specifications in temporal logic that covers all positive scenarios while excluding all negative ones. The output language in which goals and requirements are specified is the KAOS goal-based specification language. The paper also discusses how the scenario-based inference of goal specifications is integrated in the KAOS methodology for goal-based requirements engineering. In particular, the benefits of inferring declarative specifications of goals from operational scenarios are demonstrated by examples of formal analysis at the goal level, including conflict analysis, obstacle analysis, the inference of higherlevel goals, and the derivation of alternative scenarios that better achieve the underlying goals. Index Termsâ€”Scenario-based requirements elicitation, inductive inference of specifications, goal-oriented requirements engineering, specification refinement and analysis, lightweight formal methods.

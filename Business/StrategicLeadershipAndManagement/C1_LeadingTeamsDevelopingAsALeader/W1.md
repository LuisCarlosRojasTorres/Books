###  1.1. <a name='CourseOverview'></a>Course Overview

- it's not the definitive body of knowledge on leadership, not really sure what that would even look like. Since leadership is such a broad concept and such a subjective experience, there is no absolute knowledge on how to be an effective leader. It is highly individualized and contextual, you will not complete the course and say, aha, I have learned all I need to know about leadership. 
- Further this course is not a course about organizational design strategy, nor does it address the specific challenges of leaders in the most senior positions. 
- what leaders do to motivate and demotivate their teams. 
  - leadership is about being the shining light in a dark room 
  - an effective leader is the beacon of light for the team. **They don't always have all the answers, they aren't always right, but they set the course and generate the space for others to be the best versions of themselves**. So when you're stuck on, how to act as a leader, shining the light in a dark room is a good place to start.

- My approach to leadership and coaching is grounded in the belief that ethical leadership and strong team dynamics are essential for success in any field. I want to help create environments where individuals can thrive, collaborate effectively, and contribute meaningfully to their organizations.

- I teach some of our experiential learning classes with a focus on real-world problem-solving, teamwork, and putting leadership into practice.

- And I've taught courses such as introduction to management and leadership, core leadership classes for MBA students, and I've taught business ethics which I've enjoyed a lot. I've also taught negotiations and I've led lots of workshops on diversity and teams. So I look forward to seeing you in one of my classes and engaging in any of these topics.

**Course Description**
Becoming an effective leader is a practice. The purpose of this course is to help learners establish an understanding of and a practice for their leadership development. 

In the first module, we begin by defining leadership, deeply exploring the construct of leadership, the history of leadership, and encouraging learners to understand why leadership is relevant and significant in their own growth. In the second module, we then turn inward, inviting learners to explore themselves as individuals, including self-awareness, decision-making, and psychological well-being. Next, in the third module, we turn to understanding the relationship between leaders and others by exploring emotional intelligence, navigating differences of opinion, and power dynamics between individuals. Finally, in the fourth module, we wrap the course by helping learners develop a practice for growing as a leader. 

Leadership is a process, not a role. There is not one singular archetype of leadership, and so this course includes a variety of voices discussing relevant leadership concepts. Further, this course is foundational, in that it applies to anyone at any level - from an individual early in the career growth process focused on personal development to a senior level leaders in formal roles inside organizations. This course does not cover strategy, organizational design, or larger organizational level constructs.

**Course Goals and Objectives **
Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to
- define leadership in a way that facilitates personal leadership growth, 
- relate research and ideas to your own leadership experience,
- discover the role of understanding yourself to grow as a leader, 
- explore interpersonal interactions that are core to effective leadership, 
- utilize a framework to further your own leadership development, and 
- understand why and how leadership skills are so critical to organizational success.

**Course Materials **
Readings are assigned in each module. Some readings are from Harvard Business Review. You can open 3 free articles per month, or you can register and gain access to 6 free articles a month. Registration is free. We suggest that you register so you can access more articles from their website for free. 

For those who might like to read more, the two books listed below are optional, but recommended. Both of these authors contributed by being interviewed for our course. Further, the ideas from their books are woven into the content development of the course. We highly recommend both of these books for practicing leaders!

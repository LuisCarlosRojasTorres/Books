Before we begin this course, let me introduce myself. My name is JuAnne, and I'll be your instructor for this course. As a Senior Program Manager at Google for the past eight years, I have worked on cross-functional projects involving product managers, software engineers, user experience designers, network operations, customer support, and more to build software used at Google and used by Google Cloud customers. I began my career working as a liaison between customers and engineers, documenting requirements on software development projects. As I became involved in larger projects, I started to manage the timelines of the projects and coordinate the work of the different teams that had to get involved to finish the project. Before I knew it, I was the de facto project manager. I have accumulated my knowledge through formal and informal training, finding practical application in finance, insurance, and tech companies. I'm super excited to be sharing with you more about the project management discipline. During this course, you'll learn all the steps for kicking off a project. We'll start with an overview of initiation, which is the phase that allows ideas to come together and form the beginnings of a plan for a project. You identify the individual components of initiation like the project scope, goals, and deliverables. You'll also learn how to measure the success of a project. This is a super important piece of the puzzle. After all, you want to be able to meet or exceed all of the requirements for a successful project, right? Later, we'll talk about how to identify stakeholders. Stakeholders have a direct interest in the project's completion and success. We'll teach you about some really helpful tools you can use to define project roles and responsibilities and more tools and resources you typically need to complete the work of a project. Finally, we'll introduce documentation that can help your team prepare for project kickoff. Exciting, right? The skills you learn in this course will help you start projects of your own. We can't wait to get into these topics with you. So let's get started. Meet me in the next video.

###  2.1. <a name='Whyisprojectinitiationessential'></a> Why is project initiation essential?
Welcome back! In the last course, you learned that initiation is the first phase within the project life cycle, followed by planning, executing, and closing. Makes sense, right? Regardless of your chosen methodology, all projects have to start somewhere. Let's talk more about initiation and why it's important for the success of a project.
Play video starting at ::24 and follow transcript0:24
Because initiation is the first phase of the project, it's really important to get it right. A well-planned initiation results in a strong foundation for your project, and sets it up for success.
Play video starting at ::38 and follow transcript0:38
Initiation begins after a problem or opportunity has been identified within an organization.
Play video starting at ::44 and follow transcript0:44
Often, stakeholders like senior leaders at a company will initiate a project to address a specific need for the business. For example, perhaps the company would like to roll out a new product, improve employee well being, or reduce costs in a certain department.
Play video starting at :1:2 and follow transcript1:02
It's your responsibility as the project manager to help identify the project goals, resources, and other details based on initial discussions with the project stakeholders. Even though someone else might come up with an idea for the project, it's still your job to figure out all the important pieces that need to come together in order to get the work done.
Play video starting at :1:25 and follow transcript1:25
The initiation phase is a crucial time for asking stakeholders the right questions, performing research, determining resources, and clearly documenting the key components of a project. Doing this will help you solidify the scope, or the boundary, of the project. If this seems a bit overwhelming, don't worry. We'll talk more about project scope later on in this course. If the project isn't initiated properly, things can go wrong pretty fast. For example, without sufficient understanding of the project's goals, you might underestimate what resources you need or how long the project might take. Or, without agreeing with stakeholders on what success looks like, you might think the project was completed successfully, while the stakeholders might think it didn't accomplish their goals. Getting on the same page and gaining clarity during the initiation phase can save a lot of time and extra work for everyone throughout the project. Proper initiation also helps ensure that the benefits of the project outcomes will outweigh the costs of the project. To determine this, you'll do what's called a cost benefit analysis, which is the process of adding up the expected value of a project (the benefits) and comparing them to the dollar costs. To do this, you will work with stakeholders to consider a few questions. To determine the benefits of a project, those questions might include: What value will this project create? How much money could this project save our organization? How much money will it bring in from existing customers? How much time will be saved? How will the user experience be improved? And to determine the costs of the project, those questions might include: How much time will people have to spend on this project? What will be the one-time costs? Are there any ongoing costs? What about long-term costs? The benefits of a project should always outweigh the costs, so it's really important that you consider these questions early on. Coming up, we'll talk more about the initiation phase and explore the key components of initiating a project.

Bye for now!
###  2.2. <a name='Keycomponentsofprojectinitiation'></a> Key components of project initiation
Hello and welcome back. You just learned about the initiation phase of the project life cycle and why it's so important to get it right. Next, I'll teach you about the key components that make up initiation, and how these pieces lead to the planning phase of a project. There are several key components of initiation that you need to consider in order for your project to be successful: goals, scope, deliverables, success criteria, stakeholders and resources. First you need to consider the goals of the project, the goal is what you've been asked to do and what you're trying to achieve. All projects should have clear goals and often those will be determined by senior company leaders, with your help. From there, you will begin to consider the project scope. This is the process to define the work that needs to happen to complete the project. You also need to think about project deliverables. They're the products and services that you will create for your customer, client or project sponsor. Deliverables can be anything from product features and functionalities to documentation, processes and more, anything that enables the goal of your project to be achieved. Deliverables are submitted to help you reach your project goals. Also, it's important to keep in mind that the deliverables can be tangible or intangible. An example of a tangible deliverable might be submitting a chapter of a manuscript. If the goal is to publish a textbook. Or if your project goal is to finish implementation of a new point of sale software at a retail store, scheduling staff training sessions could be an intangible deliverable. Once the goals, scope and deliverables are determined, you need to consider success criteria. Success criteria are the standards by which you measure how successful a project was in reaching its goals. Another important consideration is your stakeholders. Stakeholders are key to making informed decisions at every step of the project, including the initiation phase. They're the people who both have an interest in and are affected by the completion and success of a project. As a result, they're often instrumental in determining the goals, objectives, deliverables and success criteria of the project, from coming up with the idea to outlining the expectations of its results. As you move through the initiation phase, it's your job to ensure that you understand the needs of the project stakeholders early on. It's also your role to ensure that all stakeholders are in agreement on the goals and overall mission of the project before moving on to the next phase. Now, let's talk about resources, resources generally refer to the budget, people, materials, and other items that you will have at your disposal. It's super important to think carefully about these pieces early on. No one wants to get started on a project, only to realize halfway through that they don't have enough money or enough people to complete the work. That would be a mess. Finally, once you've established your goals, scope, deliverables, success criteria, stakeholders, and resources, it's time to create a project charter. A project charter is a document that contains all the details of the project. Project charters clearly define the project and its goals and outline what is needed to accomplish them. A project charter allows you to get organized, set up a framework for what needs to be done and communicate those details to others. Once you've drafted the charter, you would then review the document with key stakeholders to get their approval to move into the planning stage. Coming up, you learn more about project charters and even get the chance to create one yourself. Hopefully you're starting to see how the key components of initiation help lay the foundation of a solid project. To quickly recap, you gather information about your goals, scope, deliverables, success criteria, stakeholders, and resources, and you document that information in the project charter. During the rest of this course, we'll talk more about each of the components outlined so far. You've come so far and learned so much, keep up the great work.

###  2.4. <a name='Afsheen:Listeningtolearn'></a> Afsheen: Listening to learn
[MUSIC] Hi, my name is Afsheen. I'm the Director of Core Capacity at Google, where we support some of our key products such as Google Maps, Google Photos, Google Search, and many more. Ultimately, what we're doing is we're managing the supply and demand for our products in the resource space, so specifically: compute, storage, machine learning, and networking resources. Ultimately, our goal is to provide the fuel for these products so we can support our billions of users. I often look at establishing the project goals, and tied to the goals is discussing the criteria. What's a successful project? What are the measurables involved in the project space? And lastly, I always want to look at the stakeholders that are involved—maybe our clients, our key stakeholders, and so on—and make sure that they're thought of during the formation of the project. I'm meeting with the stakeholders, I'm trying to understand what they're trying to achieve, what we're trying to achieve, and the goal, if you will, is a critical aspect of setting the scope. When I'm trying to set the goals of a project, I apply very in depth, active listening. I'm doing a lot of socializing with other stakeholders. I'm meeting a lot of players to understand what's the landscape like. It's an active listening experience. I have a recent example of a project that in my view did not do the proper initiation phase. Last week, in fact, a group approached me with a process or a feature that they were going to launch. I reviewed it and immediately realized that they were so far off. They had not discussed the topic with any of my team members or myself, and they were day minus one from launching the feature. It was a total miss. It really illustrates the point about when you initiate a project, you can't invest enough time in meeting with stakeholders, meeting with your colleagues, listening to them—actively listening. Someone taught me recently the value of building that "listening to learn" muscle. And in the project initiation phase, to me, that is such a valuable talent, there are those that have it, there are those that have learned it, and there those who will never do it. And I believe it's a trainable skill, but it requires you to really slow down and look at the landscape in front of you.

###  2.6. <a name='Reading:ReadingPerformingacost-benefitanalysis'></a>Reading: ReadingPerforming a cost-benefit analysis
Previously, you learned that a cost-benefit analysis is the process of adding up the expected value of a project—the benefits—and comparing them to the dollar costs. In this reading, we will discuss the benefits of conducting a cost-benefit analysis, guiding questions to help you and your stakeholders conduct one, and how to calculate return on investment (ROI).

The benefits of a cost-benefit analysis
A cost-benefit analysis can minimize risks and maximize gains for projects and organizations. It can help you communicate clearly with stakeholders and executives and keep your project on track. Because this type of analysis uses objective data, it can help reduce biases and keep stakeholder self-interest from influencing decisions. 

Comparing a project’s benefits to its costs can help you make a strong business case to stakeholders and leadership and ensure your organization pursues the most profitable or useful projects. Organizations use cost-benefit analysis to reduce waste and invest their resources responsibly.

Guiding questions for a cost-benefit analysis
When you’re pursuing a project, the benefits should outweigh the costs. It’s important for you and your stakeholders to consider questions like the ones that follow early on, while you prepare the proposal.

To determine the benefits of a project, you might ask:

What value will this project create? 

How much money could this project save our organization? 

How much money will it bring in from existing customers?

How much time will it save? 

How will it improve the customer experience?

And to determine the costs of a project, consider questions such as:

How much time will people have to spend on this project?

What are the one-time costs?

Are there any ongoing costs?

What about long-term costs? 

You might also consider questions about intangible benefits. These are gains that are not quantifiable, such as:

Customer satisfaction. Will the project increase customer retention, causing them to spend more on the company’s products or services? 

Employee satisfaction. Is the project likely to improve employee morale, reducing turnover? 

Employee productivity. Will the project reduce employee’s overtime hours, saving the company money?

Brand perception. Is the project likely to improve the company’s brand perception and recognition, attracting more customers or providing a competitive advantage?

You can also flip these questions to consider intangible costs. These are costs that are not quantifiable. For example, might the project put customer retention, employee satisfaction, or brand perception at risk?

When assigning values to tangible or intangible costs and benefits, you can reference similar past projects, conduct industry research, or consult with experts.

Calculating costs and benefits
The process of calculating costs and benefits is also called calculating return on investment, or ROI. There are many ways to determine a project’s ROI, but the easiest way is to compare the upfront and ongoing costs to its benefits over time.

One common ROI formula is:
![alt text](image.png)

In this formula, G represents the financial gains you expect from the project, and C represents the upfront and ongoing costs of your investment in the project.

For example, imagine your project costs $6,000 up front plus $25 per month for 12 months. Twenty-five dollars for 12 months equals $300 per year, meaning your total cost is $6,300. You estimate that the project will bring in $10,000 in revenue over the course of that year. That leaves you with: 

G = $10,000

C = $6,300

Now, using the formula above, you plug in the amounts as follows: 

($10,000 - $6,300) ÷ $6,300 = ROI

Then you proceed with the calculation: 

First, inside the parentheses:  10,000 - 6,300 = $3,700

Next, $3,700 ÷ $6,300 = 0.5873

Finally, 0.5873  x 100 = 58.7% 

The ROI comes to 0.587, or 58.7%. Given a strong ROI tends to be anything above 10%, you find 58.7% to be a strong ROI, so you decide to pursue the project.

Key takeaway
Performing a cost-benefit analysis can help you and your stakeholders determine if it makes sense to take on a new project by evaluating if its benefits outweigh its costs. When conducting cost-benefit analyses for your prospective projects, you can use the guiding questions and ROI formula provided in this reading as a reference.

In the last few videos, we've given you a primer on kicking off a project successfully. To recap, you learned more about initiation, the first phase of the project life cycle. Hopefully, you're starting to see how important this phase is for the overall health of a project. As we talked about earlier, a lack of preparation during the initiation stage can lead to problems later on in the project life cycle, like a budget shortage, a missed deadline, or too few teammates to complete the work. But with early planning, you can set your team up for success. We also introduced you to the major factors you should consider during the initiation phase, including goals, scope, deliverables, success criteria, stakeholders and resources. All of these come together in the early plans for a project and are documented in a project charter. Now that you understand the basic elements of initiation, let's dive deeper. Next up, we'll talk about identifying goals and deliverables and learn more about measurement and success criteria. You're doing great, and we'll see you soon.

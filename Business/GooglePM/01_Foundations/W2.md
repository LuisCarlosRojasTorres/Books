###  1.2. <a name='Thevalueofaprojectmanager'></a>The value of a project manager
- Project managers shepherd projects from start to finish and serve as guides for their team, using their impeccable organizational and interpersonal skills every step of the way.
- Project managers usually follow a process that involves planning and organizing, managing tasks, budgeting, and controlling costs so that the project can be completed within the approved timeframe. 
- Project managers play a crucial role in their organizations. Project managers add value to their teams and organizations in key ways that include:
  - Prioritization, 
  - Delegation, and 
  - Effective communication.
-  Prioritization: 
   -  Project managers add value to their teams and organizations through effective prioritization of tasks required to complete a project. 
   -  They're experts at helping team members identify and break down large tasks into smaller steps. 
   -  There'll be times when a project manager may not know which task to prioritize. To determine which ones are the most critical to the success of the project, they'll connect with their teams and with stakeholders to gather information and make a plan. 
   -  NOTE: Stakeholders are people who are interested in and affected by the project's completion and success, like the leader of an organization. 
   -  When you effectively prioritize important tasks, you set up your team and yourself for a better project outcome. 
- Delegation:
  - Project managers use delegation to add value to their teams and organizations by matching tasks to individuals who can best complete the work. 
  - So by delegating a specific task to the person with the right skills to complete the work and ordering the task appropriately, you're applying knowledge of your team's strengths to the planning of your project. 
- Effective communication:
  - Project managers deliver value through effective communication, both with their team and with key stakeholders. 
  - This refers to being **transparent**, which means being up front with plans and ideas and making information readily available. 
  - Project managers **keep in regular contact with their team about the progress of the work** and **help identify areas where a teammate may need support**.
  - In addition to keeping up with teammates, project managers** keep in regular contact with people outside of the team**, like company leaders who are invested in the project outcomes.
  - So it's a good thing you're here to keep the project running smoothly and efficiently.

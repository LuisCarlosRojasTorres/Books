This chapter presents:
- External layers as a strong capability and how can be used.
- Differtent layer types, and how their directories are organized.
- How to include a new layer in our project.

##  1. <a name='Poweringflexibilitywithlayers'></a>Powering flexibility with layers

- `metadata layer`: they are metadata-sets which covers machine definition files, classes and recipes
  - Advantage:
    - Spit the metadata into logical units, enabling users to pick only the metadata-set needed for the project.
    - Improves the reuse of code and the ability to share work accross different teams.
- Examples of custimizations can be:
  - enable/disable a feature 
  - change build flags to enable architecture-specific optimizations.
- So, when creating our **custom propject environment**, instead of changing recipes and configuration files in the Poky Layer, we shall organize the metadata in different layers.

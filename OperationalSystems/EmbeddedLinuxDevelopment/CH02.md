- Basic concepts involved in the POKY workflow.
- Download and configure, prepare the Poky build environment... and bake something usable!.
##  1. <a name='Configuringahostsystem'></a>Configuring a host system
- It depends on the distribution we run.
  - Poky has a set of supported Linux distributions, however Debian and Fedora are the best.

### Installing Poky on Debian
- The following command installs the host packages based on an Ubuntu distribution:

``` console
sudo apt install gawk wget git diffstat unzip texinfo gcc build-essential chrpath socat cpio python3 python3-pip python3-pexpect xz-utils debianutils iputils-ping python3-git python3-jinja2 libegl1-mesa libsdl1.2-dev pylint3 xterm python3-subunit mesa-common-dev zstd liblz4-tool
```

##  2. <a name='DownloadingthePOKYsourcecode'></a>Downloading the POKY source code
- Once you complete the setup instructions for your machine, you need to get a copy of the Poky repository on your build host. Use the following commands to clone the Poky repository.

``` console
git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky
```

- Go to Releases wiki page, and choose a release codename (such as `rocko` or `langdale`), corresponding to either the latest stable release or a Long Term Support release.

``` console 
$ cd poky
$ git branch -a
.
.
.
remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
remotes/origin/dunfell
remotes/origin/dunfell-next
.
.
.
remotes/origin/gatesgarth
remotes/origin/gatesgarth-next
.
.
.
remotes/origin/master
remotes/origin/master-next
.
.
.
```

- For this example, check out the langdale branch based on the Langdale release: 

``` console
$ git checkout -t origin/langdale -b my-langdale
```

- The previous Git checkout command creates a local branch named `my-langdale`. The files available to you in that branch exactly match the repositoryâ€™s files in the `langdale` release branch.

##  3. <a name='Preparingthebuildenvironment'></a>Preparing the build environment
- Inside the `Poky` directory there is a script name `oe-init-build-env` which is used to set up the building environment.
 - `[build-directory]` is an optional parameters which sets the name of the directory where the environment is located.
   - If it is empty, the `default` name is `build`.
 - It is recommended to have different `build` directories. So we can work on distinct projects in parallel or different experimental setups.

``` console
source oe-init-build-env [build-directory]
```
- Once  executed the following message is shown:

``` console
You had no conf/local.conf file. This configuration file has therefore been
created for you from /home/redtower02/poky/meta-poky/conf/templates/default/local.conf.sample
You may wish to edit it to, for example, select a different MACHINE (target
hardware).

You had no conf/bblayers.conf file. This configuration file has therefore been
created for you from /home/redtower02/poky/meta-poky/conf/templates/default/bblayers.conf.sample
To add additional metadata layers into your configuration please add entries
to conf/bblayers.conf.

The Yocto Project has extensive documentation about OE including a reference
manual which can be found at:
    https://docs.yoctoproject.org

### Shell environment set up for builds. ###

You can now run 'bitbake <target>'

Common targets are:
    core-image-minimal
    core-image-full-cmdline
    core-image-sato
    core-image-weston
    meta-toolchain
    meta-ide-support

You can also run generated qemu images with a command like 'runqemu qemux86-64'.

Other commonly useful commands are:
 - 'devtool' and 'recipetool' handle common recipe tasks
 - 'bitbake-layers' handles common layer tasks
 - 'oe-pkgdata-util' handles common target package tasks

```  

##  4. <a name='Knowingthelocal.conffile'></a>Knowing the local.conf file
- Once initialized the build environment has the following file `build/conf/local.conf`
- `local.conf`:
  - configures almost every aspect of the build process:
    - the machine target
    - the toolchain host architecture to be used
    - optimize options for maximum build time reduction
  - It has comments which are a very good documentation and a reference of possible variables and their defaults.
  - One important variable to change is `MACHINE ?? = "qemux86"` which determines the target machine we wish to build for.
    - POKY supports `genericx86` and `genericx86-64` machines.
  - This file is a convenient way to override several default configurations over all YP tools i.e. change or set any variable e.g. adding additional package.
  - Its changes are considered a **temporary change** because are not tracked by any source code management system!!.


##  5. <a name='Buildingatargetimage'></a>Building a target image

- Poky provides several predesigned image recipes that can be used to build a new custom binary image.
- To check all the images available run the following command:

``` console
$ ls meta*/recipes*/images/*.bb
```

- This is a list of the most common used images:
  - `core-image-minimal`:a small image allowing a device to boot, and it is very useful for kernel and boot loader tests and development.
  - `core-image-base`: a console-only image that fully supports the target device hw.
  - there are more items with different properties such as `real time` and so on.
- To build an image for a target run the following command:

``` console
$ bitbake <recipe name>
```

For example to build `core-image-full-cmdline`, run the following command: `$ bitbake core-image-full-cmdline`

##  6. <a name='RunningimagesinQEMU'></a>Running images in QEMU

- **QEMU** for **Quik EMUlator** a free an open-source software package that performs hardware virtualization.
- To run the emulator:

``` console
$runqemu <machine> <zimage> <filesystem>
```
- Where:
  - `<machine>`: machine/architecture to be used e.g. `qemux86`, `qemux86-64`.
  - `<zimage>`: (optional) the path to a kernel e.g. `zimage-qemuarm.bin`.
  - `<filesystem>`: (optional) the path to an `ext3` image (e.g. `filesystem-qemuarm.ext3`) or an `NFS` directory.

- For example:

``` console
$runqemu qemuarm core-image0full-cmdline
```

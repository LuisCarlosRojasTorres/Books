 - Unix has been around quite a bit longer than Linux. But these two operating systems are indeed related. 
   - Linux is a Unix-like operating system that is open source. This means that the Linux kernel, created by Linus Torvalds and enhanced and expanded upon by thousands of programmers, is available to the world for free. 
 - An operating system is an intermediary between the hardware- memory, hard disk, processor, Wi-Fi network cards, et cetera- and the applications that we all use. 
   - Indeed, you as the user use the services rendered by applications. 
   - Applications use the services provided by the operating system. 
   - And the operating system exploits the hardware resources that are at its disposal to render these services to the applications. 
 - Examples of services provided by the operating system. 
   - File management. That is, managing the logical tree structure of files and their physical layout on the storage device, also known as the hard drive. 
   - Memory management. Memory can be shared between several running processes. 
   - Also management of running applications. We are talking about running processes. You can run an application, kill a running application, et cetera. 
   - Management of inputs and outputs. For example, network cards to access the internet, sound cards, video cards, printers, et cetera. 
 - the history of the operating system. 
   - In the mid-1940s, the first computers were built using vacuum tubes. Vacuum tubes are evacuated glass containers that can control electric current and can therefore function as on-off switches. These tubes are rather large. And each of these first computers used quite a few of them, resulting in huge machines that filled entire rooms while performing more slowly than a modern hand-held calculator. 
   - Programming of these machines had to be done manually by moving around tubes. And input-output was very limited. In fact, the programmer was also in charge of operating the machine via direct interaction, which meant a lot of heavy lifting. So in fact, the designer of the computer was also the builder of the computer, and at the same time the programmer as well as the operator. 
   - Everything changed with the invention of the transistor. At the same time, this marks the beginning of operating systems via the appearance of punch cards. Punch cards are cards with holes, punches, placed in specific locations so as to encode computer programs and data that can be loaded via the computer's punch card reader into the computer's memory. Punch cards can also be used as computer output. A separation of roles emerged. A programmer produced punch cards-- programs that input data-- and an operator physically loaded these cards into the computer and unloaded the computer's output. 
   - That is when the operating system was invented to manage the memory, the processes, programs loaded while running, and these punch cards, inputs and outputs, reading punch cards, writing the results. 
     - We can therefore say that it was in the mid-1960s that operating systems were invented.

##  1. <a name='Workingwitharraysandpointers'></a>Working with arrays and pointers
- NOTE: `a[0]` is pronounced as `a of 0`

###  1.1. <a name='Defineandworkwitharraysofpointersandusemultiplewaysfordereferencing'></a>Define and work with arrays of pointers and use multiple ways for dereferencing

- Define and work with arrays of pointers and use multiple ways for dereferencing
  - Creating an array of pointers let you have an array of arrays.
  - ![Alt text](image.png)

``` c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void){
    short a[3] = {234,655, 843};
    short b[2] = {12, 62};
    short c[4] = {3456, 3467, 23, 276};
    short * arrays[3] = {a, b, c};
    // This array of pointers has?
    // a which is a pointer with the address of a[0]
    // b which is a pointer with the address of b[0]
    // c which is a pointer with the address of c[0]
    return 0;
}
```
- If we change the value of `*array[0]` the value of `a[0]` will change. So for example:
``` c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void){
     //! showMemory(cursors=[a, arrays[0], b, arrays[1], c, arrays[2]], start=65520)
    short a[3] = {234,655, 843};
    short b[2] = {12, 62};
    short c[4] = {3456, 3467, 23, 276};
    short * arrays[3] = {a, b, c};
    * arrays[0] = 5;
    return 0;
}
```
- It will change the `a[0]` value
  - ![Alt text](image-1.png)

- To change the value of a[1], it shall be used *pointer arithmetic* `a[1]` is equal to `*(array[0]+1)`

``` c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void){
     //! showMemory(cursors=[a, arrays[0], b, arrays[1], c, arrays[2]], start=65520)
    short a[3] = {234,655, 843};
    short b[2] = {12, 62};
    short c[4] = {3456, 3467, 23, 276};
    short * arrays[3] = {a, b, c};
    * arrays[0] = 5;
    * (arrays[0] + 1) = 6; //Pointer arithmetic
    return 0;
}
```
- It will change `a[1]`
  - ![Alt text](image-2.png)

- So to change the other arrays, i.e. `b` it shall be used `arrays[1]`

``` c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void){
     //! showMemory(cursors=[a, arrays[0], b, arrays[1], c, arrays[2]], start=65520)
    short a[3] = {234,655, 843};
    short b[2] = {12, 62};
    short c[4] = {3456, 3467, 23, 276};
    short * arrays[3] = {a, b, c};
 
    * arrays[0] = 5; // a[0] = 5
    * (arrays[0] + 1) = 6; // a[1] = 6
    * (arrays[0] + 2) = 7; // a[2] = 7
    * arrays[1] = 3; // b[0] = 3
    * (arrays[1] + 1) = 4; // b[1] = 4
    return 0;
}
```
- There is a second way to access to the arrays pointed by `arrays` vector. It is called `double indexed notation`. So: 
  - `* arrays[0] = a[0] = arrays[0][0]`
  - `* (arrays[0]+1) = a[1] = arrays[0][1]`
  - `* (arrays[0]+2) = a[2] = arrays[0][2]`  
  - `* arrays[1] = b[0] = arrays[1][0]`
  - `* (arrays[1]+1) = b[1] = arrays[1][1]`

###  1.2. <a name='Usepointerstopointersanddereference'></a>Use pointers to pointers and dereference 
1. We have `a` and `b` arrays, and `t` which is an array which contains the initial positions of `a` and `b` so its a pointer. For that reason its type is `short *`.
``` c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
     //! showMemory(cursors=[t, t[0], t[1]],start=65520)
    short a[3] = {1245, 1924, 234};
    short b[2] = {24, 256};
    short * t[2] = {a,b};
    
    return 0;
}
```
2. So, the function `setToZero(t)` will replace all the values of the arrays with `0`. The prototype of the function is a `short **` why?
   - `t` is a pointer, which contains tha pointers `a` and `b`
   - so, `*t` is returns `a` and `b`
   - but, to change the values of the elements `a` and `b` we need to have `*a` and `*b`. Which is `**t`.
       
``` c
#include <stdio.h>
void setToZero(short **)
int main(){
     //! showMemory(cursors=[t, t[0], t[1]],start=65520)
    short a[3] = {1245, 1924, 234};
    short b[2] = {24, 256};
    short * t[2] = {a,b};
    setToZero(t);
    return 0;
}
```
3. so the implementation of `setToZero` is as follows:
   1.  `*t` points to `t[0]` which is `a`, but `**t` is `*a` which is `1245`
   ![Alt text](image-3.png)
   2. `*((*t) + 1) = 0`
      -  `*t` points to `a[0]` so `*(*t+1)` points to `a[1]`


``` c
#include <stdio.h>
void setToZero(short **);
int main(){
     //! showMemory(cursors=[t, t[0], t[1]],start=65520)
    short a[3] = {1245, 1924, 234};
    short b[2] = {24, 256};
    short * t[2] = {a,b};
    setToZero(t);
    return 0;
}
void setToZero(short ** t){
    *(*t) = 0; //t[0][0] or *(t[0]+0) or a[0]
    *((*t) + 1) = 0; ////t[0][1] or *(t[0]+1) or a[1]
    *((*t) + 2) = 0; //t[0][2] or *(t[0]+2) or a[2]
    *(*(t+1)) = 0; //t[1][0] or *(t[1]+0) or  b[0]
    *(*(t+1)+1) = 0; //t[1][1] or *(t[1]+1) or b[1]
}
```

    // Add one line here! 
    /* The line you add should use the array cookie (and not the array wet) to 
       find the sum of the wet ingredients of the cookie recipe and store that sum
       in the variable totalWet. Use only indexed notation to address the cookie
       array (that is, you need to use two pairs of brackets [..]). 
    */

    printf("Total amount of wet ingredients: %.2lf grams.\n", totalWet);
    
    // Add one line here! 
    /* The line you add should use the array cookie (and not the array dry) to 
       find the sum of the dry ingredients of the cookie recipe and store that sum

       time you address the cookie array. 
    */

    printf("Total amount of dry ingredients: %.2lf grams.\n", totalDry);
    ratio = totalDry/totalWet;
    printf("Ratio of wet to dry ingredients: %.2lf.\n", ratio);

    // Add two lines here.
    /* The lines you add should use the array cookie (and not the array wet) to
       update the amounts of water and oil in your recipe. 
       You believe that any cookie recipe should use equal amounts of water and oil.
       Without changing the total amount of wet ingredients, update the values for
       water and oil, using only the array cookie (and not the array wet) so that 
       these amounts will be equal. The easiest way to do so is to assign the value
       totalWet/2 to both the water and the oil entry. When addressing the array cookie,
       do not use any brackets at all this time.
    */
    
    printf("New water amount: %.2lf grams, new oil amount: %.2lf grams.\n", wet[0], wet[1]);

###  2.1. <a name='Exercise-1'></a>Exercise

Your goal is to read a 68-word text from the input and then print it to the screen backwards. Individual words do not have to be spelled backwards, but rather your program should print out the last word first, then the second-to-last word, etc. No word has more than 40 characters.

"The best programs are written so that computing machines can perform them quickly and so that human beings can understand them clearly. A programmer is ideally an essayist who works with traditional aesthetic and literary forms as well as mathematical concepts, to communicate the way an algorithm works and to convince a reader that the results will be correct." ― Donald Ervin Knuth, Selected Papers on Computer Science

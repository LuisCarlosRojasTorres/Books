## Understanding computer memory
- John Von Neumann created a model that describes he insides of a computer. Von neumann architectore aka Princeton Architecture.
- It Splits the computer in 4 parts:
  - `ALU` or `Arithmetic Logic Unit`: performs basic operations (`+` `-` `*` `/`) also logical operations i.e. `and` `or` `not`
  - `Control Unit`: coordinates the operation and sequence of data movements between the other parts of the architecture.
    - `ALU` and `Control Unit` form the `CPU` or `Central Processing Unit`
  - `Memory`: which serves data and programs. It comes in two flavors:
    - Temporary memory (RAM i.e. Random Access Memory): 
    - Lasting memory e.g. hard drives.
  - `Computer input and output`: enables communication between the computer and the external world i.e. users, peripherals and even other computers.
### Memory representation, RAM, cells, word, byte, bit, memory address
- RAM:
  - Random access memory
  - temporary, easy and quick to access
  - used to execute programs
  - aka volatile memory
- Lasting memory
  - nonvolatile memory
  - e.g. hard drives
- When a program is running its variables are stored, written and read from RAM
- RAM is represented as a sequence of binary memory cells. Each cell is called `1 bit`.
- Grouping severals of these `cells`  makes a `word`. A `word` can be 8, 16, 32 pr even 64 bits.
  - A memory address is assigned to each `word`, which us a whole number that describes the location of the word in the computer memory.
    - In C it is possible to get this memory address.
- The use of memory addresses allows low-level acces to the computer by allowing direct access to its memory.
## Determining the amount of memory used for different data types
- `%zu` is to print the size.
``` c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    char c;
    int i;
    double d;
    char listChar[3];
    int listInt[3];
    double listDouble[3];
    
    printf("%zu\n", sizeof(c)); //1
    printf("%zu\n", sizeof(i)); //4
    printf("%zu\n", sizeof(d)); //8
    printf("%zu\n", sizeof(listChar)); //3
    printf("%zu\n", sizeof(listInt)); //12
    printf("%zu\n", sizeof(listDouble)); //24
    return(0);    
}
```
### Exercise
- Your program should first read an integer number indicating how many tracking codes you plan on entering. Next, for each successive tracking code your program should read in the integer length of code followed by a space and then the type of code ('i' for integer, 'd' for decimal, or 'c' for character). Finally your program should print the total amount of space required to store all of the tracking codes (in bytes). If the user enters an incorrect type for any tracking number, the program should print 'Invalid tracking code type' and exit.
  
``` console
#input:
3
10 i
7 c
12 d 
#output:
143 bytes
```

``` c
#include <stdio.h>

int converter(int num, char letter)
{
 if(letter == 'i')   
 {
    return num*4;
 }
 else if(letter == 'c')
 {
    return num;
 }
 else if(letter == 'd')
 {
    return num*8;
 }
 else
 {
    return -1;
 }
}
    
int main()
{
    int n;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    int i;
    int total = 0;
    for(i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        int value;
        char unit;
        scanf("%d %c", &value,&unit);
        
        if(unit != 'd' && unit != 'i' && unit != 'c')
        {
            printf("Invalid tracking code type");
            return 0;
        }
        total += converter(value,unit);
    }
    printf("%d bytes", total);
}
```
- Some problems representing big numbers
  - When this program is running even when the addition in hexadecimal is correct, the decimal representation is *wrong**
    - 2147483645 which is 7F FF FF FD
    - 2147483646 which is 7F FF FF FE
    - 2147483647 which is 7F FF FF FF
    - -2147483648 which is 80 00 00 01
    - -2147483647 which is 80 00 00 02
    - -2147483646 which is 80 00 00 03
    - -2147483645 which is 80 00 00 04
  - This is the two's complement representation
    
``` c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    //! showMemory(start=65520)
    int num = 2147483645; //7F FF FF FD
    int i;
    
    for (i=0; i<8; i++) {
        printf("%d\n", num);
        num = num+1;
    }
    
    return(0);
}
```

- double values have precision problems
``` c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    double num = 0.3;
    
    printf("the number is %.20lf\n", num); 
    //0.29999999999999998890
    printf("the number is %.40lf\n", num); 
    //0.2999999999999999888977697537484345957637
    
    // float uses less bytes...
    float num = 0.3;    
    printf("the number is %.40f\n", num);
    //0.3000000119209289550781250000000000000000
    return(0);
}
```

- Your job is to write a program that shows, in human-readable form (see below for specifics), how much memory a set of variables of a certain type will use. Your program should read a character that identifies the data type ('i' for int, 's' for short, 'c' for char, 'd' for double). Next it should read an integer that indicates how many variables of the given type you wish to store.
  - Your program should then calculate the amount of memory required to store the given variables. Your program needs to be written in such a way that it would also perform correctly on other computers. In other words, rather than hard-coding specific sizes for the different variable types, your program needs to use the "sizeof()" function to determine how much memory an individual variable of a given type needs.
  - Finally, you need to output the amount of space required by your variables to the screen. You need to make sure you provide this output in a form that is easy to read for humans. The following examples illustrate what this means:

``` c
#include <stdio.h>

int converter(int num, char letter)
{
 if(letter == 'i')   
 {
    return num*4;
 }
 else if(letter == 'c')
 {
    return num;
 }
 else if(letter == 'd')
 {
    return num*8;
 }
 else
 {
    return -1;
 }
}
    
int main()
{
    int value0;
    char unit;
    scanf("%c %d",&unit,&value0);
    int value = 0;
    value = converter(value0, unit);

    if(value > 999999)
    {
        //5 MB and 234 KB and 0 B
        int mb = value/1000000;
        int kb = (value%1000000)/1000;
        int b = (value%1000000)%1000;
        printf("%d MB and %d KB and %d B",mb,kb,b);
    }
    else if(value  > 999)
    {
        int kb = (value%1000000)/1000;
        int b = (value%1000000)%1000;
        printf("%d KB and %d B",kb,b);
    }
    else{
        int b = (value%1000000)%1000;
        printf("%d B",b);
    }
}
```

## Determining the scope of variables
- a
``` c

```
- Scopes and Blocks in C
``` c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    //! showMemory(start=65520)
    int a = 10;
    int b = 11;
    {
        int c = 12;
        int d = 13;
        int e = a + c;
        c = b + d;
        printf("c: %d\n", c);
        printf("e: %d\n", e);
    }
    //When finished all the variables in the block are forgotten
    //This variable overrides the data in the block
    int f = 14;
    int g = 15;
    printf("f: %d\n",f);
    printf("g: %d", g);
}
```

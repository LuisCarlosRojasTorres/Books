##  1. <a name='Usingstringsi.earraysofcharacters'></a>Using strings i.e arrays of characters

- To store strings as an array of chars it is always needed an extra space for the null terminator. 
- So, scanf has the following parameters:
  - `%d` for integers
  - `%lf` for doubles
  - `%c` for characters
  - `%s` for strings
    - It does not need the `&`!! i.e. `scanf("%s", arrayCharacter)`


``` c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
    char word[4]; //arrray of characters (string) for a three letters
    printf("Please enter a word with 3 letters: ");
    scanf("%s", word);
    printf("The word read is: %s.\n", word);
    return 0;
}
```

- It is posible to print or change some characters 

``` c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
    //! showArray(word, cursors[i])
    char word[4]; //arrray of characters (string)
    printf("Please enter a word with 3 letters: "); //write fun
    scanf("%s", word);
    printf("The word read is: %s.\n", word);
    printf("The characters are: <%c> <%c> <%c> <%c>\n", word[0], word[1], word[2], word[3]);
    word[1] = 'a';
    printf("The new word is %s\n", word);
    return 0;
}
```

### Exercise 
- Write a C-program that prints out a word as many times as specified. The number of repetitions and the word should be given as input to the program. You may assume that the word has no more than 100 characters (be sure to also reserve space for the null terminator, \0, though!).

``` c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
    int n;
    char word[101]; //arrray of characters (string)
    scanf("%d %s", &n, word);
    
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        printf("%s\n", word);    
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```
##  2. <a name='Usingthespecialnullterminatortoidentifytheendofastring'></a>Using the special null terminator to identify the end of a string

- `printf` prints all the string up to the `\0` character
``` c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
    //! word1 = showArray(word1, cursors=[i], width=0.5)
    //! word2 = showArray(word2, cursors=[i], width=0.5)
    char word1[5];
    char word2[8];
    scanf("%s %s", word1, word2);
    word1[3] = '\0';
    word2[2] = '\0';
    printf("%s %s\n", word1, word2);
    return 0;
}

```
### Excercise
- Your program should first read the total number of names (an integer) in order to know how many index cards need to be processed altogether. Next,  for each index card, your program should read a patron's first name and last name and then display these names correctly, that is on one line, the last name followed by one space, followed by the first name.  Your program should print the reversed name immediately after reading the patron's names (ie, it should not wait until it has read all of the index cards to begin printing). 
- 
``` c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
    int n;
    char name[101]; //arrray of characters (string)
    char surname[101]; //arrray of characters (string)
    scanf("%d", &n);
    
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        scanf("%s %s", name, surname);
        printf("%s %s\n", surname, name);    
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

##  3. <a name='Findingthelengthofastring'></a>Finding the length of a string

- iterate through the array and have a counter
``` c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
    //! showArray(word, cursors=[i])
    char word[30];
    int i = 0;
    printf("Please enter a word: ");
    scanf("%s", word);
    while (word[i]!='\0') 
        i++;
    printf("%s has word length %d.\n", word, i);
    return 0;
}
```
### Exercise
- At the annual meeting of MOOC fans, participants register on the first day of the event in order to receive their name tags, brochures and banquet vouchers. Unfortunately this often results in long lines. In an attempt to speed things up, there are now two people working the registration desk: one person who has the registration materials for those fans whose names contain an odd number of letters, the other for those whose names have an even number of letters. Your job is to write a C-program that will tell a fan which line to stand in.

- To simplify the program, you may assume that student names are less than 50 characters long and contain no spaces. Your program should output an integer value (1 or 2) depending on whether the fan should join line 1 (name has even number of letters) or line 2 (name has odd number of letters).
``` c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
    //! showArray(word, cursors=[i])
    char word[51];
    int i = 0;
    
    scanf("%s", word);
    while (word[i]!='\0') 
        i++;
        
    if(i % 2 == 0)
    {
        printf("1");
    }
    else
    {
        printf("2");
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

##  4. <a name='Workingwithstringlengths'></a>Working with string lengths

``` c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
    //! showArray(word, cursors=[t])
    //! showArray(length, cursors=[i])
    int i = 0;
    int t = 0;
    int l = 0;
    int j = 0;
    int nbWords = 0;
    char word[11];
    int length[10];//length[5] number of 5-letter-long words in the text
    for(i=0;i<10;i++){
        length[i]=0;
    }
    scanf("%d", &nbWords);
    for(t=0;t<nbWords;t++){
        scanf("%s", word);
        l = 0;
        while(word[l]!='\0'){
            l++;
        }
        length[l] = length[l] + 1;
        printf("%s %d ", word,l);
    }
    for(j=0;j<10;j++){
        printf("There are %d words with %d letters.\n", length[j], j);
    }
    return 0;   
}

```

- Your job is to find the length of the longest word in a text with no punctuation or special characters of any kind - only contains words. To do so, please write a C-program that takes as a input first the number of words in a text, followed by all of the words in the text. The output of your program should be the length of the longest word in the text.

- To simplify your program, you can assume that the longest word will not exceed 100 characters.
``` console
# input
14
This is a simple example text
we have to find the largest word length
# output
7

```

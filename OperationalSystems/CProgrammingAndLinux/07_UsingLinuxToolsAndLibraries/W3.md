##  1. <a name='Usingargumentsformain'></a>Using arguments for main()

###  1.1. <a name='Passargumentstoaprogramfromthecommandline'></a>Pass arguments to a program from the command line

- To receive parameters from terminal we need to add arguments into the `main` function:

``` c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    int i;
    printf("I have %d arguments from the command line: \n", argc);
    for (i = 0; i<argc; i++) {
        printf("Argument %d: %s\n", i, argv[i]);
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

- So if we put on the terminal:
`./program -e -t`

- The output is:

``` 
I have 3 arguments from the command line:                                       
Argument 0: ./program                                                           
Argument 1: -e                                                                  
Argument 2: -t      
```
- The `0` index is always the name of the program!!!
 
###  1.2. <a name='Useargumentspassedtoaprogramfromthecommandline'></a>Use arguments passed to a program from the command line
 
- The following code:

``` c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h> // for atoi and atof
#include <string.h> // for strcmp

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    int i, compare, wholeNumber;
    double decimalNumber;
    
    printf("I have %d arguments from the command line: \n", argc);
    for (i = 0; i<argc; i++) {
        printf("Argument %d: %s\n", i, argv[i]);
    }
    
    if (argc == 4) {
        compare = strcmp(argv[1], "-e");
        if (compare ==0) {
            printf("argv[1] equals -e \n");
        } else {
            printf("argv[1] does not equal -e \n");
        }
        wholeNumber = atoi(argv[2]);
        printf("%s as an integer is %d.\n", argv[2], wholeNumber);
        decimalNumber = atof(argv[3]);
        printf("%s as a double is %lf.\n", argv[3], decimalNumber);
    }
    return 0;
}
```
- It is called through: `./program -e 43 23.88`
  - It has 4 arguments 
  - all arguments are strings so they shall be converted to `float` or `decimal` using `atoi` (`atoi` = `ascii to integer`) and `atof` (`atof` = `ascii to float`)

- The output is:

```
 $ ./program -e 43 23.88                                                       
I have 4 arguments from the command line:                                       
Argument 0: ./program                                                           
Argument 1: -e                                                                  
Argument 2: 43                                                                  
Argument 3: 23.88                                                               
argv[1] equals -e                                                               
43 as an integer is 43.                                                         
23.88 as a double is 23.880000. 
```
### Excercise
- Input from the command line (via argv): 
  - `5 2.39`
- Output:
  - `5 plants for 2.39 dollars each cost 11.95 dollars.`

Solution:

``` c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h> // for atoi and atof
#include <string.h> // for strcmp

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
	int a;
	double b, total;
	
	if(argc == 3)
	{
		a = atoi(argv[1]);
		
		b = atof(argv[2]);
		
		total = a*b;
		printf("%d plants for %.2lf dollars each cost %.2lf dollars.",a,b,total);
	}
	else 
	{
		printf("Invalid input.");
	}	
	
	return 0;
}
```

##  2. <a name='Readingfromafile'></a>Reading from a file

###  2.1. <a name='Readnumbersfromafile'></a>Read numbers from a file
- No spaces in the name.

``` c 

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    FILE *ifile;  /* ifile is a variable name - you could use any other name here. 
                     However, the '*' is important - we are working with a pointer. 
                     We call this a file pointer. */
    int i, num, N;
    
    ifile = fopen("my_first_file.txt", "r"); /* open file for reading. 
                                                     The "r" stands for reading. */
    
    fscanf(ifile, "%d", &N); /* Read first number from the file.
                                Just like scanf(), the only difference is the 
                                file pointer that gets passed in as well. */
                                
    printf("There are %d numbers in the file.\n", N);
    
    for (i = 0; i<N; i++) {
        fscanf(ifile, "%d", &num);
        printf("I read %d from the file. \n", num);
    }
    
    fclose(ifile); /* closes the file */    
    return 0;
}
```

- `my_first_file.txt`
```
9
56  3  8  -11  0  -45  55  2  78
```
- `my_second_file.txt`
```
6
13.5 22.7 8.0 -4.3 2.99 6.66
```

### Excercise
- Input file "studentGrades.txt": 
```
4
100 99 90 98
```
- Output: 
```
96.75
```

- Solution

``` c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
	FILE *ifile;  /* ifile is a variable name - you could use any other name here.
	However, the '*' is important - we are working with a pointer.
	We call this a file pointer. */
	int i, N, num, total;
	double mean;
	
	
	ifile = fopen("studentGrades.txt", "r"); /* open file for reading.
	The "r" stands for reading. */
	
	fscanf(ifile, "%d", &N); /* Read first number from the file.
	Just like scanf(), the only difference is the
	file pointer that gets passed in as well. */
	
	total = 0;
	
	for (i = 0; i<N; i++) {
		fscanf(ifile, "%d", &num);
		total = total + num;
		
	}
	
	mean = (double) total / N;
	
	printf("%.2lf", mean);
	
	fclose(ifile); /* closes the file */
	return 0;
}
```

##  3. <a name='Readinguntiltheendofthefile'></a>Reading until the end of the file

###  3.1. <a name='Readuntiltheendofthefile'></a>Read until the end of the file
- There is no necessary an initial value saying how many values are in the file.
- So, instead of `my_first_file.txt`
```
9
56  3  8  -11  0  -45  55  2  78
```

- we can use `my_third_file.txt`
```
56  3  8  -11  0  -45  55  2  78
```
- A code for this is shown below:
  - `EOF` means End Of File
``` c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    FILE *ifile;  
    int i, num, sum;
    int N, done, message;
    
    ifile = fopen("my_third_file.txt", "r"); 
                                
    N=0;
    sum = 0;
    done = 0; 
    
    while (!done) {
        message = fscanf(ifile, "%d", &num);
        if (message == EOF) done = 1;
        else {
            printf("I read %d from the file. \n", num);
            sum += num;
            N++;
        }
    }
    
    fclose(ifile);
    
    printf("There are %d numbers in the file.\n", N);
    printf("The sum of the numbers read is %d.\n", sum); 
    printf("The average is %.2f.", (float) sum / N);
    
    return 0;
}
```

- A more elegant version is:

``` c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    FILE *ifile;  
    int i, num, sum;
    int N;
    
    ifile = fopen("files/my_third_file.txt", "r"); 
                                
    N=0;
    sum = 0;
    
    while (fscanf(ifile, "%d", &num) != EOF) {
        printf("I read %d from the file. \n", num);
        sum += num;
        N++;
    }
    
    fclose(ifile);
    
    printf("There are %d numbers in the file.\n", N);
    printf("The sum of the numbers read is %d.\n", sum); 
    printf("The average is %.2f.", (float) sum / N);
    
    return(0);
}
```

### Excercise
- You are still teaching a class on C-programming! You would like to find out whether the students in your class did better on the most recent assignment than the students in your colleagues' classes. The average grades of all these classes are stored in a file called "gradeComparison.txt". The first number stored in the file represents the average grade of the students in your class. All of the subsequent numbers represent the average grades of students from other sections. For example, if the file contained the following:
-`95.23 94.80 91.56` this would mean that the students in your class received an average grade of 95.23 on the last assignment, which is higher than the average grades received by students in the other sections.
- If, on the other hand, the file was `95.23 94.80 91.56 96.40 93.25` then this would mean that the students in the fourth class received a slightly higher grade than the students in your class.  
- Your job is to find out whether the students in your class did better than the students in the other classes and if so, print out the word "Yes". If on the other hand students in another class did better than your students then you should print out "No", followed by one space, followed by the number of the first class in the file that had a better grade average.

- Example1:
  - Input file "gradeComparison.txt": 
  - `95.23 94.80 91.56`
  - Output: 
  - `Yes`
- Example2: 
  - Input file "gradeComparison.txt": 
  - `95.23 94.80 91.56 96.40 93.25 99.64`
  - Output:
  - `No 4`

 - Solution:

``` c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
	FILE *ifile;
	double num;
	int firstTime;
	int N, biggestIndex;
	
	double myValue;
	ifile = fopen("gradeComparison.txt", "r");
	
	N=1;
	biggestIndex = 1;
	firstTime = 1;
	
	while (fscanf(ifile, "%lf", &num) != EOF) {
		
		if(firstTime == 1){
			firstTime = 0;
			myValue = num;
		}
		else
		{
			if(num > myValue){
				biggestIndex = N;
			}
		}
		
		N++;
	}
	
	fclose(ifile);
	
	if(biggestIndex == 1)
	{
		printf("Yes");
	}
	else{
		printf("No %d", biggestIndex);
	}
	
	
	return(0);
}

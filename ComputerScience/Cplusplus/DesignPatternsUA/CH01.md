## Design Patterns

- A `design pattern` is a practical proven solution to a recurring design problem.
- They are not just concepts, They are actual solutions used in the industry.
- They help to fix `spaghetti code`
- It is not always easy to determine which design pattern to use to solve a sw design problem. So study and practice to ease the decision.
- They are more than `source code`, they are `knowledge` that you can apply to improve the structure of the software making it `flexible and reusable`

- além de só `source code`, são `knowledge` que pode ser aplicado para melhorar a estrutura do software.


[Creational Patterns](/ComputerScience/Cplusplus/DesignPatternsUA/CH02-Creational.md)
- They tackle **how you handle creating or clonning new objects**

1. Singleton
2. Factory Method

[Structural Pattern](/ComputerScience/Cplusplus/DesignPatternsUA/CH03-Structural.md)

- Describe **how objects are connected to each other** and **how subclasses and superclasses interact through inheritance**
- Relates to the design principles of: 
  - Decomposition
  - Generalization
- Similar to *pairing different kinds of foods together*

1. Façade
2. Adapter
3. Composite
4. Proxy
5. Decorator
   
[Behavioral Pattern](/ComputerScience/Cplusplus/DesignPatternsUA/CH04-Behavioral.md)

- Focus on ***how objects distribute work and describe how each object does a single cohesive function**
- Similar to *racing car pit crea at a track*. These kind of pattersn lays out the overall goal and purpose for each object.

1. Template method
2. Chain of Responsability
3. State Pattern
4. Command Pattern
5. Observer Pattern

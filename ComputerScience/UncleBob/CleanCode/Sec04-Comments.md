> "Dont comment bad code - reqrite it!!" - B. Kernigham and P. Plaugher
- No good.
- No bad.
- Only a **necessary evil**
- Coments compensate out failure to express ourself in code.
- Every time you express yourself in code, you should pat yourself on the back.
  - Every time you write a comment, you should grimace and feel the failure of your ability of expression.
- Nobody maintains comments!
- Truth can only be found in one place: the code!!
  
##  1. <a name='GoodComments'></a>Good Comments

###  1.1. <a name='LegalComments'></a>Legal Comments
- It refers to a standard licence or other external document rather than putting all the terms and conditions into the comment.

###  1.2. <a name='Informative'></a>Informative Comments
- Explain the parts of the code which needs additional knowledge to understand. E.g. Regex, mathematical formulas
  
###  1.3. <a name='Explanation'></a>Explanation Comments
- Provides the intent behind a decision in the code.

``` cpp
// Euler method only for testing integration
void EulerImplicitMethod(...)

// RK4 method an easy but accurate method! 
void RungeKutta4Method(...)
```
###  1.4. <a name='Clarification'></a>Clarification Comments
- To translate the meaning of some obscure `argument` or `return` value (part of the standard library or in code that you cannot alter!!)into something readable.
- RISKY!!!
  - There is a risk that the clarifying comment is incorrect.
  
###  1.5. <a name='WarningofConsequences'></a>Warning of Consequences Comments
- To warn other programmers about certain consequences.

``` cpp
// This test takes almost two hours two finish
// Dont run unless you have some time to kill
void _testWithRealBigFile(){...}
```

- To warn why some code is implemented in that way, a which consequences will raise if is modified.

``` cpp
static SimpleDateFormat makeStandardHttpDateFormat(){
	//SimpleDateFormat is not thread safe,
	//so we need to create each instance independently.
	SimpleDateFormat df = new SimpleDateFormat("EEE, dd MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss z");
	df.setTimeZone(TimeZone.getTimeZone("GMT"));
	return df;
}
```

###  1.6. <a name='TODO'></a>TODO Comments
- TODOs are jobs that the programmer thinks should be done, but for some reason canâ€™t do at the moment. Once it is implemented , it shall be deleted.
- It might be:
  - A reminder to delete a deprecated feature 
  - a plea for someone else to look at a problem 
  - a request for someone else to think of a better name 
  - a reminder to make a change that is dependent on a planned event.
- It is no excuse do leave **bad code** in the system.


###  1.7. <a name='Amplification'></a>Amplification Comments
- Amplify the importance of something that may otherwise seem inconsequential.
  
``` cpp
	// Thi is SO important to accelerate the results and increase accuracy!
	DataPreProcessing();
```

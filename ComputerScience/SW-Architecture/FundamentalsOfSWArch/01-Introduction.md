``` console
Software Architecture = Structure Of the Software       + 
                        Architecture Characteristics    + 
                        Architecture Decisions          + 
                        Design patterns
```
- Software Architecture consist of 4 topics:
  - **Structure of the Software**: This is the Architecture pattern of the Software.
  - **Architecture Characteristics**: The non-functional of the software, i.e., they do not require knowledge about the functionality of the software, however they are required in order to work properly. 
    - Testability, Elasticity, Performance Scalability, etc are Architecture Characteristics.
  - **Architecture Decisions**: It definnes the rules and constraints of how the software shall be constructed and what is and what is not allowed (e.g., Which layers can access to DB).
  - **Design Principles**: Defines guidelines to allow the developer to choose the most appropriate technique/framework/etc.

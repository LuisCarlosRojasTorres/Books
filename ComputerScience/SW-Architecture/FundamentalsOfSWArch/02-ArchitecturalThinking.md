##  2. <a name='TechnicalBreadth'></a>Technical Breadth
- A Software Architecture shall have a significant amount of *technical depth*.
- All technical knowledge in the world can be represented by the *knowledge pyramid* (Figure a):
  - *Stuff you know* (green): things that it is used every day
  - *Stuff you know you don't know* (yellow): things that you heard of or have little or no expertise in 
  - *Stuff you don't know you don't know* (orange): it would be the perfect solution for a problem but you dont even know those things exist.
- For a *developer* it is recommended to (Figure b):
  - to focus on the green area, to get experience and expertise.
  - invest time and effort to maintain green area up to date
  - Note: green area height is known as `technical depth`
- For an *Architect* it is recomended to:
  - focus on green and yellow areas of the pyramids
  - focus on `technical breadth` rather than `technical depth` (Figure c)
- Eventually the `architect knowledge pyramid` becomes similar to (Figure d) where some areas of expertise will remain and others atrophy.

###  1.6. <a name='ReadingBeforeyoulearnReact'></a>ReadingBefore you learn React
- To get the most out of this course on React basics, you should first understand the fundamental methods and concepts of JavaScript. Otherwise, you may feel like you’re a child learning to run before you can walk. React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.
- React apps are built using modern JavaScript features, which are commonly known as ES6. Developers use React to develop Singe Page Applications. And you can also develop mobile applications with React Native.
- For example, with a solid foundational knowledge of JavaScript, you can quickly identify code that is JavaScript ES6 and code that is React. And throughout this course, there will be help for you along the way with some friendly reminders. 
- To build interfaces with React you also need HTML and CSS code.
  
- **HTML**
  - Layout & Style
    - `<html> <head> <body> <div>`
  - Text formatting & lists
    - `<h1>…<h6> <p> <ul><li> <b><i>`
  - Images and links
    - `<img src=""> <a href="">`
  - Linking and Meta
    - `<link> <title> <meta>`
  - Semantic
    - `<header>`
- CSS
  - Font styling (font size, font color, etc.) 
  - Flex Box Layout (Layout of items using CSS Flex Box Layout) 
  - CSS Selectors 
  - Position, Padding, Margins and Display 
  - Colors, Background and Icons 
- JS
  - Data types 
  - Using var, let and const 
  - Conditionals and Loops 
  - Using objects, arrays and functions 
  - ES6 Arrow functions 
  - In-built functions such as map(), forEach() and promises. 
  - Destructuring Arrays and Objects 
  - Error Handling 
- Package Manager (Node+npm)
  - React is a UI library, and you will encounter that many times you will need to add other packages to your React application. A package in JavaScript contains all the files needed for a module. To install these packages effectively and manage their dependencies you can use a package manager like NPM (Node Package Manager).
  - You can install npm by installing Node.js, which will then automatically install npm.
  - You need to be comfortable with using npm as your package manager, since you will be using npm to install packages within your React application.  Make sure you are aware of how to do the following with npm before you get started on this course.
  - Installation command to install npm modules in your project 
  - Installing a package as a dev dependency 
  - Start command 
  - Updating npm version 
  - Navigating around the package.json file 
  - Once you have become confident with these skills, you’ll be in a better position to learn and apply React concepts and prepare yourself for development of React apps.
###  1.7. <a name='ReadingJavaScriptmodulesimports-exports'></a> ReadingJavaScript modules, imports - exports

- Modules can help you to save and access your code in a more structured way, and in this reading, you'll learn about some foundational concepts of working with JavaScript modules.
  - This knowledge is crucial in order to understand the syntax and the logic behind how the example React apps in this course are put together.
- This reading will cover the three main concepts:
  - JavaScript modules 
  - Module exports 
  - Module imports 
    
####  1.7.1. <a name='JavaScriptmodules'></a>JavaScript modules 
- In JavaScript,** a `module` is simply a file**.
- Purpose: 
  - have more modular code, where you can work with smaller files, and import and export them so that the apps you build are more customizable and have more composable parts.
- A `module` can be as simple as a single function in a separate file.
- For example:

``` js
// addTwo.js
function addTwo(a, b) {
    console.log(a + b);
}
```

- To convert this into a `Javascript module` it is used the `export syntax`
  
####  1.7.2. <a name='Moduleexports'></a>Module exports 
-In general, there are two ways to export modules in JavaScript:
  - Using `default exports`:
    - You can have **one default export** per JavaScript module. 
    ``` js
    // One way to perform a default export is:
    export default function addTwo(a, b) {
        console.log(a + b);
    }
    // Another is way is:
    function addTwo(a, b) {
        console.log(a + b);
    }
    export default addTwo;
    ``` 
  - Using `named exports`:
    -  a way to **export only certain parts** of a given JavaScript file.
    -  you can export as **many items** from any JavaScript file as you want.
    ``` js
    // For the addTwo and addThree functions
    function addTwo(a, b) {
        console.log(a + b);
    }

    function addThree(a + b + c) {
        console.log(a + b + c); 
    }
    // One way to export as a named export is :
    export function addTwo(a, b) {
    console.log(a + b);
    }

    export function addThree(a + b + c) {
        console.log(a + b + c);
    }
    // Another way is
    function addTwo(a, b) {
    console.log(a + b);
    }

    function addThree(a + b + c) {
        console.log(a + b + c);
    }

    export { addTwo, addThree };
    ```  
####  1.7.3. <a name='Moduleimports'></a>Module imports 
- The syntax to import a module into a file depends on the type of export:
  - Lets say there are two modules in a folder: `addTwo.js` and `mathOperations.js`. And you want to import the `addTwo.js` module into the `mathOperations.js` module.
  - If `addTwo.js` has a default export:
    ``` js
    //import <name to be used inside the importer modu from> from <location of the file>
    import addTwo from "./addTwo";
    ``` 
  - For a named export:
    ``` js
    import {addTwo} from "./addTwo";
    ``` 

###  1.8. <a name='ReadingWorkingwithLabsinthiscourse'></a>ReadingWorking with Labs in this course
- All labs in this course needs the following steps:
  1. Open the project folder in VisualStuioCode
  2. Run `npm start` in the terminal of VSCde
  3. Click in `Open Development server`. This will open the app in the browser in a separate tab.
     - This link is located on the blue horizontal bar at the very bottom of the lab window.
- To view a preview of the rendered react code:
  1. `View -> Editor Layout -> Two Colums`  
  2. Right click in the file to render and click on `Open Preview` (in the `EXPLORER` sidebar)
  3. Select and drag another files to the `Preview` column in order to render.


###  1.9. <a name='ReadingAdditionalreading'></a>ReadingAdditional reading
Below you will find links to helpful additional readings.
- `nodejs.org` 
- `npmjs.com `
- `reactjs.org `
- `https://create-react-app.dev/ `
- `VS Code `


###  1.10. <a name='ReadingSettingupaReactprojectinVSCodeOptional'></a>ReadingSetting up a React project in VS Code (Optional)

To complete the exercises in this course you have been provided with a dedicated lab environment set up specifically for you to apply the skills that you have learned. You can find out more about Working with Labs in this course by accessing the link below:

[Working with Labs in this course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/react-basics/supplement/7e8Ea/working-with-labs-in-this-course)

You can also use VS Code to practice these exercises on your local machine as an alternative option.

To follow along in this reading, you need to have Node.js and VS Code already installed on your computer. If you don’t have this setup, please refer to the Programming with JavaScript course:

**Setting up VS Code:**
1. Download and Install VSCode
2. Install `CodeRunner` extension


**Installing Node and NPM :**
- Windows
  1. To install Node.js go to [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
     1. Download the package and install it
  2. To verify that Node.js installed on your computer run `node --version`.
  3. To verify that npm is installed: `npm --version`

- Ubuntu
  1. Run `sudo apt update`
  2. Run `sudo apt install nodejs`
  3. To verify that Node.js and npm: `node --version && npm --version` 

In VS Code, you're ready to start a brand new React project.

You can do it using npm.

**What is npm**
- It permits Author your own Node.js modules ("packages"), and publish them on the npm website so that other people can download and use them 
- Use other people's authored modules ("packages") 
- Whenever you run the npm command to add other people's code,** that code, and all other Node modules that depend on it, get downloaded** to your machine.
  - You can avoid this running `npm init react-app <nameOfTheApp>`

**Opening the built-in VS Code terminal and running npm init react-app command**
1. Open the project folder
2. Open the built-in terminal
3. Run `npm init react-app <nameOfTheApp>` (it takes some minutes)

Once the installation is finished:
1. Run `cd <nameOfTheApp>`
2. Run `npm start`

The internet navigator will open a tab with React interface.
##  2. <a name='ReactComponentesandWheretheylive'></a>React Componentes and Where they live

###  2.1. <a name='WhyReact'></a>Why React?
- Because some people pay for it.
  - Angular: full solution
  - React: only front-end, requires third-party libraries
###  2.2. <a name='React.jsoverview'></a>React.js overview
React is a powerful tool for streamlining the process of building components and composing them. It performs these actions efficiently as components are rendered to the DOM without significantly impacting the browser's resources.

- single-page application or SPA: an one-page website where some of the pages content changes based on user interaction. 
- SPA differ from traditional website, where each web page needs to be loaded as the user navigates around the site. 
  - This frequent reload can be considered inefficient as some of the **same content** such as `logos`, `navigation`, and `footers` need to be loaded again. 
- **SPA only load the content as required**, they can be ideal for businesses and enterprises who need a web app that offers rich user interfaces, speed scalability, and flexibility. 
- In this video, you will learn about the basics of React by exploring the concepts of:
  -  the component-based architecture:
     - a design philosophy for building software based on reusable components of code.
     - Each component consists of well-defined functionality that can be inserted into an application without requiring modification of other components
  -  components:
     -  standalon parts of a UI
     -  Simple components can be combined into a more complex component
     -  Reusables: used multiple times and easily inserted anywhere where needed
     -  Independent: Components can exist within tha same space independently from each other. 
     -  One of the advantages of developing using components:  many developers can work on the same project without interfering with the code of other developers' components.
  -  the virtual DOM: 
     -  DOM: is a logical tree-like structure representing the HTML document and it uses `"nodes"` to describe the various parts of the document 
     -  React provides something known as the `virtual DOM`. You may recall that this is an in-memory representation or clone of the real DOM which minimizes updates to the DOM itself. React uses the `virtual DOM` to update the `browser DOM` only when needed. This ensures that the update is as minimal as possible, increasing the application speed and performance.
  

###  2.3. <a name='Introductiontofunctionalcomponents'></a>Introduction to functional components
-  a React component acts much like a traditional JavaScript function
   - functions in JavaScript: They are reusable blocks of code that can take an input, perform some procedure or calculation, and then return an output. 
- Component types: 
  - React provides two types of components, `functional components` and `class Components`. They behave very similar in React to traditional functions, and classes in JavaScript.   
  ``` js
  // Functional Component
  function Welcome()
  {
    return <h1> "Hello" </h1>
  };
  // Class Components
  class Welcome extends React.Component
  {
    render() 
    {
      return <h1> "Hello" </h1>
    };
  };
  ```
  - `functional components`:
    - In the default React application, only one component is rendered and it's the app components located inside the `index.js` file that's located inside the `source folder`
    ``` js
    // index.js
    import React from 'react';
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

    import App from './App.js' // root component  loaded using import statement

    ReactDOM.createRoot(
      document.querySelector('#root')
    ).render(<App/>) //render root component
    ``` 
  - It's important to know that **every React app must contain at least one component**, and it's called the `root component`.
    -  The `roots components` can contain other components that developers create to represent the various UI part of the application
  - This component is loaded using the `import` statement
  - The syntax to render a component is very similar to a self-closing tag in HTML, you just place the component name inside the left and right angle brackets and don't forget the forward slash and the CAPITALIZED e.g. `<ComponentName/>`. 
  - The roots components can contain other components that developers create to represent the various UI part of the application. e.g:
    - `ReactApp` 
      - `Root Component` contains:
        - `Header`
        - `Sidebar`
        - `Main`
- JSX
  - React is scripted using a special syntax called JavaScript XML or `JSX`. For many Reacts developers, this is known as a syntax extension to JavaScript. 
  - Very similar toa combination of custom HTML and JavaScript
  - The App.js, an example of JSX
  ``` js
  function App()
  {
    return (
      <div className='App'>
        <h1> Hello React.</h1>
      </div>
    );
  };
  export default App;
  ``` 
  - This sintax can be put it inside the return statement of a functional component.
    - A react component **wont render until its used** as a `JSX element`  just like a JS function declaration and **wont run until its called or invoked**.
  - Steps to create a React Component:
    1. Create a js file e.g. `Heading.js` (first letter capitalized)
       - React treats tags with Capitalized letters as React Components otherwise as a HTML components.
    2. Inside the `App.js` file create a function named `Heading` 
    ``` js
    function Heading(){ // Capital letter
      let title = "This is some heading text";
      return(
        <h1>{title}</h1> // between {} to return variable and not the word 'title'
      );
    }
    ``` 
- `transpiling`:
  - Irterprets a programming language and traslates it to a specific target language e.g. converting JSX to HTML
###  2.4. <a name='CreatingReactcomponents'></a>Creating React components
1. Create a React-app project and run with `npm start`
2. Open src folder in EXPLORER sidebar
3. Open `App.js` and delete the code inside `App() function`. The code is presented below:
  
``` js
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

function App() {
}
export default App;
```
4. Save the changes, this makes `npm` to render the code.
5. Add a `Header function`
``` js
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';
function Header(){
  return <h1> Hola Rufo </h1>
}

function App() {
}
export default App;
```
6. Save the changes, no `Header` is render why?
7. Add to `App` function to render the `Header`
``` js
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';
function Header(){
  return <h1> Hola Rufo </h1>
}

function App() {
  return <Header />
}
export default App;
```
8. Save the changes, now the `Header` is rendered.

###  2.5. <a name='ReadingTranspilingJSX'></a>ReadingTranspiling JSX
**Introduction**
- Components are a nice way to build websites in React because they allow you to build more modular apps. However, how do you build components using React, JSX, and JavaScript? You'll learn how this works in this lesson item.

**A browser cannot understand JSX syntax.**
- This means that making a browser understand React code requires a lot of supporting technologies.
- An example of such a technology is a transpiler.
- A **transpiler** takes a piece of code and transforms it into some other code.
- To understand why this is done, here is an example of an ES6 variable declaration:

``` js
const PI = 3.14
```

- This is perfectly valid ES6 syntax.
- However, if you were using a very old computer, that computer will have an old browser. Perhaps that browser was built before ES6 came out in 2015.
- This means that the JavaScript engine that is built into your old computer's browser is likely to be an ES5 JavaScript engine.
- In ES5, the only way to declare a variable is the following:

``` js
var pi = 3.14
```

What this means is that for this old browser to understand the ES6 code, the only way to do it is by transpiling it.

If you feel like it, you can try transpiling ES6 to ES5 code yourself, using the es6console website.

Now, let’s move the focus to another example of transpiling.

Let's say that you want to use a brand new, most modern ECMAScript syntax in an app. The only problem is that this new syntax is currently not supported by any browser; even an up-to-date browser.

However, by transpiling the new most-modern JavaScript syntax into something that modern browsers can understand, it is able to convert some code that the browser cannot comprehend, into code that it can comprehend, run, and produce a result from.

Likely the most popular site that shows off how this works is [babel](https://babeljs.io/). As the heading of the website reads, "Babel is a JavaScript Compiler".

This finally brings you to the point of this discussion about transpiling JavaScript code.

What Babel does is this: it allows you to transpile JSX code (which cannot be understood by a browser) into plain JavaScript code (which can be understood by a browser).

This is where React and JSX come in.

For React code to be understood by a browser, you need to have a transpiling step in which the JSX code gets converted to plain JavaScript code that a modern browser can work with.

To demonstrate how this works, let’s use the Heading component from the previous lesson.

Add the JSX code into the online Babel repl. Repl stands for "read-eval-print loop" and it accepts code you write, evaluates it, and produces some result. In the specific case of the online Babel repl, that result is some transpiled code. Here's a more detailed explanation.

If you've visited the above-linked URL, you'll find a web page that has two panels. On the left, there's source JSX code:

``` js
function Heading(props) {
    return <h1>{props.title}</h1>
}
```

... and on the right, there's the transpiled, plain JavaScript code:

``` js
"use strict";

function Heading(props) {
  return /*#__PURE__*/React.createElement("h1", null, props.title);
}
```
If you now analyze the difference between the source JSX code and the transpiled, plain JavaScript code, dis-regarding the comment, here's the body of the Heading function:
``` js
React.createElement("h1", null, props.title);
```

So, here you have a React object, and this object has a createElement() method on it. The method is invoked with three arguments:
- `"h1"` 
- `null` 
- `props.title` 

The first argument is the DOM element to render - in this case, an `h1` element. The second property is any HTML attribute that should be added, and there's a null here - meaning, there should be an object with some data, but there isn't any data so instead of the object there's the null value. The third property is the contents of the inner HTML of the DOM element specified as the first argument - in this case, the contents of the inner HTML of the `h1` element.

Now let’s use Babel again, and this time transpile the `render` syntax for the `Heading` component:

``` js
<Heading title="This is the heading text!"></Heading>
```

Again using the Babel repl, and as can be confirmed in the link, the output of the tranpilation is the following code:

``` js
"use strict";

/*#__PURE__*/
React.createElement(Heading, {
  title: "This is the heading text!"
});
```

Again, you have the `React.createElement()` method call, and this time, the first item to render is `Heading`, and then you have an object as the second argument (instead of a null that you had in the previous transpilation example).

This brings me to an interesting question: What is the minimum code that a component must have to be able to show something on the screen when rendered?

You can see the answer below:

``` js
function Example() {
    return <div>An element</div>
}
export default Example
```

###  2.6. <a name='Lab:Yourfirstcomponent'></a>Lab: Your first component
- Step 1
  1. Add a new function to the App component, named Heading . 
  2. Once this folder is open, locate the src folder, and inside of it, the App.js file. Click on the App.js file in the EXPLORER to have it open.
  3. Now you're ready to add a new function to the App component, and name that function Heading. Place it at the very top of the App.js file.

- Step 2
  1. In the body of the Heading component, add a return statement.
- Step 3
  1. To the right of the return keyword, add the following JSX code: <h1>This is an h1 heading</h1> 
- Step 4
  1. Save your changes and view the app in the browser.
- Tip: If you’re having trouble with this lab, please review the "Create React components" video.  This video covers all of the concepts that you’ll need to successfully complete this lab.

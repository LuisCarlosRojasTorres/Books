##  1. <a name='EventhandlersandSignalsandSlots'></a>Event handlers and Signals and Slots
- GUIs are event driven, i.e. they respond to events that are created by the user,
from a keyboard or a mouse, or by events caused by the system, such as a timer or when
connecting to Bluetooth.
  - When `exec()` is called, the application begins listening for events until
the program is closed.
- Event handling is handled by:
  - `Event Handlers`: which take care of events. 
    - There are different types of events that can be handled, e.g. `paintEvent()`  or `keyPressEvent()`.
    - In `Qt`, events are objects created from the `QEvent` class.
  - OR
  - `Signals and Slots`: handle the communication between objects in Qt, such as widgets.
    - `Signals:` 
      - generated whenever an event occurs, e.g. a button is clicked or a checkbox is toggled on or off.
      - Those signals then need to be handled in some way.
    - `Slots:` 
      - methods that are connected to an event and executed in response to the `signal`.
      - can either be :
        - built-in PyQt functions 
        - Python functions that you create yourself.
    - Each `PyQt` class has its own signals and slots (which can be inherit).
      - For example:
        - `button.clicked.connect(self.buttonClicked)`
          - `clicked` is the `signal`.
            - To use the signal, it shall `connect()` some `slot`
          - `self.buttonClicked` is the `slot` which will perform some action.
      - Many `signals` can also pass additional information to the `slot`
      - Custom signals are covered in **CH07**
##  2. <a name='TheQPushButtonWidget'></a>The QPushButton Widget
- When `QPushButton`  is clicked, it sends out a `signal` that can be connected to
a function.
- The following code is an example of this.
  - It is possible to align the contents of widgets with `setAlignment()`
    - `AlignLeft`, `AlignRight`, `AlignHCenter`, `AlignVCenter`, `AlignTop` and `AlignBottom`

            self.button.setText("Feelin' Lucky?")

- GUIs are event driven, i.e. they respond to events that are created by the user,
from a keyboard or a mouse, or by events caused by the system, such as a timer or when
connecting to Bluetooth.
  - When `exec()` is called, the application begins listening for events until
the program is closed.
- Event handling is handled by:
  - `Event Handlers`: which take care of events. 
    - There are different types of events that can be handled, e.g. `paintEvent()`  or `keyPressEvent()`.
    - In `Qt`, events are objects created from the `QEvent` class.
  - OR
  - `Signals and Slots`:

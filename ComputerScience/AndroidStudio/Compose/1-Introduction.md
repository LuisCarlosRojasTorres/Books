## C2 - Jetpack Compose Basics
### Declarative vs Imperative
- Imperative: the old xml style.
- Declarative: 
  - Focus on describe the **desirable outcome** rather than specify the step-by-step instructions.
  - UI appearance is defined based on the current state.
  - UI structure, layout and behaviour are described through the UI elements and its properties.
  - more emphasis on *inmutable state* , where the UI is represented by *inmutable data objects*. So: *instead of directly mutating the state, we create new instances of the data objects to reflect the desired changes in the UI*.
  - The framework takes care of updating the UI based on changes in the application state.

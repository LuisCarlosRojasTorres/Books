## What is it?
- It is the name of a set of methods (which are overloaded) without its parameters.
          
## What is its purpose?
- How to use a delegate when a method belong to a method group.

## Important Concepts
- The conversion to delegate is only possible if the method group has a single best match for the delegateâ€™s signature. Otherwise (multiple methods match) will issue an error.

### How to use

1. Create an overloaded method: e.g. `Add`

``` cs 
class Calculator
{
    public static int Add(int a, int b) => a + b;
    public static double Add(double a, double b) => a + b;
}
```
2. Create a delegate that match one signature of the method group.

``` cs 
//This signature match with first Add method
delegate int DummyDelegate(int a, int b);
```

3. Create a program to assign the delegate

``` cs
class Program
{
    delegate int DummyDelegate(int a, int b);

    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
    //This signature match with first Add method
    
    //Method group assigned to delegate
    DummyDelegate dummy = Calculator.Add;

    //The Add method that best batch the delegate signature is referenced!        
    var result = dummy(10, 20);

    Console.WriteLine(result);
    }
}
```

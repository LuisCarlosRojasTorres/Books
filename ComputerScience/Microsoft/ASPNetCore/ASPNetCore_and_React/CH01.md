## Introduction

- **React** mature library for building component-based front-ends.
- **ASP.NET Core** mature open source and cross platform web application framework. For back-ends that interact with databases and cloud platforms.

This chapter will show:
1. What is a **single-page application (SPA)**
2. Explanation of *React and ASP.NET Core* app and how they integrate with each other.
3. How VS runs both and packages them up.

## SPA architecture

- It is a web app that loads a single HTML page that is dynamically updated by Javascript as the user interacts with the app (through `HTTP requests`).

## Understanding the ASP.NET Core backend
- Once we instantiate the app template we will:
  - Inspect the Net Core code, starting from its **entry point**
  - Learn how the request/response pipeline is configured
  - How requests to endpoints are handled

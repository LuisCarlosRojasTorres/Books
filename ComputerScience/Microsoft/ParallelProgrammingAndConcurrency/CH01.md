Here you will learn:
- How to create and destroy threads
- Handle exceptions
- Synchronize data
- Utilize the objects provided by .NET to handle backgroun operations
- A basic understanting of how threads can be managed in a .NET application
- 
##  1. <a name='ThreadingBasics'></a>Threading Basics

- The `System.Threading` namespace has benn available since `.NET Framework 1.0`
  - So, what a `thread` is and how can be used by the application processes is a **MUST**.


###  1.1. <a name='Threadsandprocesses'></a>Threads and processes
- Threads and processes are the basic units of application processing
- A `process` encapsulates all the execution of an application. It is an `.exe` or `hosted service`
- A `thread` represents a single unit of execution within a process.
  - By defaults .NET applications executes all its logic on a `single main thread`
###  1.2. <a name='WhenshouldweusemultithreadinginNET'></a>When should we use multithreading in NET?
- There are internal and external (to the application) factors:
  - External:
    - The HW where the SW will be deployed
      - The power of the processor
      - Which other processes will be running on these systems?
  - Internal: 
    - if there are Limited resources, be judicious with the use of multiple threads
    - if it impact on performance, reduce number of threads
    - if the application is **mission-critical**, allocate more resources!
    - Yes for desktop and mobile UI responsive applications.
    - Yes for long-running tasks which parallel processing can reduce the overall execution time
      - If the task is not critical, it can be sent to `background threads` .
###  1.3. <a name='Backgroundthreads'></a>Background threads
- `Foreground threads`: 
  - Threads that will prevent the managed process from terminating if they are running.
  - The default option
- `Background threads`: 
  - If the application is terminated, `background threads` will be stopped so that the process can shut down.
- Steps:
  1.   Set `Thread.IsBackground` property to true
  2.   Start the `thread`
- It is possible to use the `Thread.IsBackground` property on existing `threads`

- The code below creates a background thread:
    - This thread iterates until the application is closed
``` cs
//Example CH01A
var bgThread = new Thread(() =>
{
    while (true)
    {
        bool isNetworkUp = System.Net.NetworkInformation.NetworkInterface.GetIsNetworkAvailable();
        Console.WriteLine($"Is network available? Answer:{isNetworkUp}");
        Thread.Sleep(2000);
    }
});

bgThread.IsBackground = true; // Background property
bgThread.Start();

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Main thread working...");
    Task.Delay(10000);
}

Console.WriteLine("Done");
Console.ReadKey();
```

- This code is implemented in [CH01A](https://github.com/LuisCarlosRojasTorres/CSharpLearning/tree/main/ParallelProgAndConcurrency/CH01A), its  output is presented below:
  
``` console
Main thread working...
Main thread working...
Main thread working...
Main thread working...
Main thread working...
Done
Is network available? Answer:True
Is network available? Answer:True
Is network available? Answer:True
...
```

- The program executed all the logic of the primary thread before starting any of the background thread work.
  - Later it is explained how to change the priority of the threads to manipulate which work will be processed first.
- The important thing here is that it is possible to stop the console application by pressing a key (due to `Console.ReadKey` command).
  - Even if the `background thread` is still running, the process does not consider the thread to be critical to the application.
  - If `bgThread.IsBackground = true` the application will have to be stopped by clossing the command window or with `Debug| Stop Debugging`.


  
###  1.4. <a name='Whatismanagedthreading'></a>What is managed threading? 
- **Managed threading**: 
  - It is implemented by the `System.Threading.Thread`
  - All the threads that have been run as a part of a process are monitored by a managed execution environment (specific for this process).
  - Manage threads can be uniquely identified using the `ManagedThreadId` property of the `Thread` object. 
    - This property is unique accross all threads and donot change over time
- **Unmanaged threading**:
  - How Cpp with Native Win32 threads are managed.

The `ThreadState` property is a read-only property which provides the current execution state:
- `Aborted`: thread has been aborted
- `AbortRequested`:abort has been requested but has not yet been completed
- `Background`: thread is running in the background
- `Running`: thread is running
- `Stopped`: 
- `StopRequested`: 
- `Suspended`:
- `SuspendRequested`: 
- `Unstarted`: thread was created but not started
- `WaitSleepJoin`: thread is currently blocked
##  2. <a name='Creatinganddestroyingthreads'></a>Creating and destroying threads
- Additional constructors of the `Thread` class
- Few methods of pausing or interrupting thread execution
- Few ways to destroy or terminate a thread execution


###  2.1. <a name='Creatingmanagedthreads'></a>Creating managed threads

- To create a `managed thread` you shalll instantiate a new `Thread` object.
- There are 4 overloaded constructors:
  1. `Thread(ParameterizedThreadStart)`: 
     - It creates a new Thread object. It does this by passing a delegate with a constructor that takes an object as its parameter that can be passed when calling `Thread.Start()`.
  2. `Thread(ParameterizedThreadStart, Int32)`: 
     - This adds a `maxStackSize` parameter. 
     - Avoid using this overload because it is best to allow .NET to manage the stack size.
  3. `Thread(ThreadStart)`: 
     - It creates a new Thread object that will execute the method to be invoked, which is provided as the `ThreadStart` property
  2. `Thread(ThreadStart, Int32)`: 
     - This adds a `maxStackSize` parameter. 
     - Avoid using this overload because it is best to allow .NET to manage the stack size.
- The previous example uses the `Thread(ThreadStart)` constructor.
- An example of using the `Thread(ParameterizedThreadStart)` constructor is presented below:
  - `bgThread.Start(12)`  makes the thread iterates `12` times. 

``` cs
var bgThread = new Thread((object? data) =>
{
    if (data is null) return;
    int counter = 0;
    var result = int.TryParse(data.ToString(), out int maxCount);
    
    if (!result) return;
    
    while (counter < maxCount)
    {
        bool isNetworkUp = System.Net.NetworkInformation.NetworkInterface.GetIsNetworkAvailable();
        Console.WriteLine($"Is network available? Answer: {isNetworkUp}");
        Thread.Sleep(1000);
        counter++;
    }
});

bgThread.IsBackground = true;
bgThread.Start(3); // This limits the iteration to 12 times!

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Main thread working...");
    Task.Delay(10000);
}
Console.WriteLine("Done");
Console.ReadKey();
```
- This code is implemented in [CH01B](https://github.com/LuisCarlosRojasTorres/CSharpLearning/tree/main/ParallelProgAndConcurrency/CH01B), its  output is presented below:

``` console
Main thread working...
Main thread working...
Main thread working...
Main thread working...
Main thread working...
Done
Is network available? Answer: True
Is network available? Answer: True
Is network available? Answer: True
...
```

- The program executes just like the last example, but the background thread should only
output `3` lines to the console.
- To get a reference to the thread that is executing the current code, you can call:
    - Then its `ManagedThreadId`, `Priority` can be called.
``` cs 
var currentThread = System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread;
```
###  2.2. <a name='Pausingthreadexecution'></a>Pausing thread execution
- `Thread.Sleep` is a `static` method that will block the **current thread** for the number of milliseconds specified.
  - It is not possible to call `Thread.Sleep` on a thread other than tha **current one**.


- The example from previous section was edited so:
  - Its `Thread.Sleep` interval is set to `10`
  - It is not a background thread anymore
  - `Task.Delay` was change with `Task.Sleep`

``` cs
var bgThread = new Thread((object? data) =>
{
    if (data is null) return;
    int counter = 0;
    var result = int.TryParse(data.ToString(), out int maxCount);

    if (!result) return;

    while (counter < maxCount)
    {
        bool isNetworkUp = System.Net.NetworkInformation.NetworkInterface.GetIsNetworkAvailable();
        Console.WriteLine($"Is network available? Answer: {isNetworkUp}");
        Thread.Sleep(100);
        counter++;
    }
});

bgThread.Start(4); // This limits the iteration to 3 times!

for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Main thread working...");
    Thread.Sleep(250);
}
Console.WriteLine("Done");
Console.ReadKey();
```
- This code is implemented in [CH01C](https://github.com/LuisCarlosRojasTorres/CSharpLearning/tree/main/ParallelProgAndConcurrency/CH01C), its  output is presented below:

``` console
Main thread working...
Is network available? Answer: True
Is network available? Answer: True
Main thread working...
Is network available? Answer: True
Is network available? Answer: True
Main thread working...
Main thread working...
Done
...
```
- The `Thread.Sleep` intervals can be adjusted to see how they impact hte `console` output.
  - In this case the thread finished its work before the main thread
  
- On the other hand `Thread.Sleep(Timeout.Infinite)`:
  - It pauses the thread until it is interrupted or aborted by another thread or the managed environment.
    - To interrupt call `ThreadInterrupt`, the thread will receive a `ThreadInterruptException`
    - Call `ThreadInterrupted` in a running thread have no effects until the thread has benn blocked.
###  2.3. <a name='Destroyingmanagedthreads'></a>Destroying managed threads
- It is considered an *unsafe practice**
  - NET6 does not support `Thread.Abort` method
- To terminate a thread use `cancelation` instead.

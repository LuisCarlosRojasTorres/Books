- A `class library` defines types and methods that are called by an application.
- If the library targets .NET Standard 2.0, it can be called by any .NET implementation (including .NET Framework) that supports .NET Standard 2.0. If the library targets .NET 6, it can be called by any application that targets .NET 6. This tutorial shows how to target .NET 6.
- It can be distributed as a NuGet package or as a component bundled with the application that uses it.
- It can be done in two ways:
  - Referencing a project
  - Referencing a `dll`
